  - "Event payload JSON moves from the Events tab to a new raw-events card in the dev-only DebugTab"
  - "The Actions card now shows the user-facing sync error text (formatSyncErrorForUser with last_sync_error_code); raw text and code stay in DebugTab"

# Phase 01.9 Plan 12: Survey detail screen split Summary

The 1 344-line survey detail screen and its 836-line styles file are now a 290-line entry plus parts in `screens/survey-detail/`. The entry keeps its path, export name and props. All its text is French and comes from the catalogue. The Debug surface only exists in dev builds. All 9 Pressables have a role, a catalogue label and a disabled state where relevant.

## Final file layout (largest file 313 lines)

| File | Lines | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| SurveyDetailScreen.tsx | 290 | Entry: derived state, scroll compression, composes the parts |
| DetailHeader.tsx | 294 | Sticky hero: rename, compact/full header, progress, submit card |
| MediaSection.tsx | 312 | Map preview / photo carousel, switch thumb, add/delete photo alerts |
| SummaryTab.tsx, FactorsSection.tsx, DetailActions.tsx | 149 / 178 / 70 | Summary tab |
| EventsTab.tsx, DebugTab.tsx, DetailTabBar.tsx | 52 / 145 / 38 | Other tabs and the chip bar |
| AttachmentPhotoPreview.tsx, useLocalDraftSummary.ts, hero-state.ts, event-labels.ts | small | Shared component, draft hook, hero label helpers, event labels |
| styles.ts, header/media/summary/tabs.styles.ts | 30–313 | Styles next to their parts |

## Gates (all 0)

- `structure-report long-files`: 0. `unused-styles`: 0 (25 dead keys deleted). `literals`: 0.
- `npx eslint src/screens/SurveyDetailScreen.tsx src/screens/survey-detail --max-warnings 0`: clean (112 warnings before).
- `grep formatEventPayload survey-detail | grep -v DebugTab`: empty.
- App-wide counts: unused styles 301 → 276, long files 10 → 8, literals 635 → 516.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 64 suites, 833 tests pass, and the thresholds hold.
- The new tests: `DetailTabBar.test.tsx` has 6 tests covering the tab bar with dev tools on and off, EventsTab showing no JSON or ids, and DebugTab rendering null in release. `event-labels.test.ts` has 16 tests.
- The render harness `src/state/render-counts.test.tsx` passes unchanged.
- `npm run lint` has 0 errors, `npm run typecheck` is clean, and `prettier --check` passes on the changed files.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **Parts renamed or added inside the folder (allowed by the plan).** `AttachmentsSection.tsx` became `MediaSection.tsx`. The plan also allowed adding `AttachmentPhotoPreview.tsx`, `useLocalDraftSummary.ts` and `hero-state.ts`. These keep the entry under 400 lines.
2. **Style file split.** Instead of the single `styles.ts`, there are five style files (see decisions), because a single file would have been over 400 lines.
3. **[Rule 2] User-facing sync error line added.** The old screen had no user-facing sync error text, only the raw error in the Debug tab. The interface note asks for `formatSyncErrorForUser(last_sync_error, last_sync_error_code)`, so the Actions card now shows it.
4. **Task 1 hero-state field names.** The fields are `caption` and `heading`, not `label` and `title`, so the interim English strings did not raise the literal ratchet in the Task 1 commit. Task 2 moved them to the catalogue.
5. **Small visible changes in Task 2.** A factor that is not filled now shows "Non renseigné" (the internal sentinel is unchanged). The progress percent reads "40 %". The "--" placeholder is now "—".

## TDD Gate Compliance

RED 09444ff (tests failed: module and catalogue keys missing), then GREEN fbb072f.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. T-01.9-24 is mitigated by the double `shouldShowDevTools()` gate, with render tests for both states. T-01.9-25 is mitigated because the labels take the site name, a position or a factor title, never an id.

## Commits

- c9726b4 refactor(01.9-12): split survey detail screen into survey-detail parts
- 09444ff test(01.9-12): add failing tests for dev-only debug surface and event labels
- fbb072f feat(01.9-12): French survey detail text, dev-only debug surface and accessible Pressables

## Self-Check: PASSED
