# Phase 01.9: Mobile state architecture, i18n, accessibility and hygiene - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-09-26
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Owner answers during `/gsd:plan-phase 1.9` after research, plus Claude's technical decisions. Where this file differs from 10-RESEARCH.md, this file wins.

## Phase Boundary

This phase covers audit lots L18, L19 and the rest of L20:

- **State:** memoised mobile state, so a status update or a keystroke no longer re-renders every tab.
- **Lists and screens:** a fluid survey list, screens under 400 lines, dead styles removed, typed navigation.
- **Map:** loads by viewport, clusters markers and debounces region changes.
- **Text and accessibility:** a French text catalogue, and accessible `Pressable`s in the survey detail, survey form and map screens.
- **Repository hygiene:** root leftovers and unused dependencies removed.
- **Native builds:** checked in CI.

Phase 01.8 (shared IBP domain package) has not been done yet, and the owner chose to plan 01.9 first. Everything that does not depend on 01.8 is done now. The three items that do depend on it (see D-12) go into a short closing plan that runs after 01.8.

Installed apps keep working: the API change for the map (D-05) is additive.

## Implementation Decisions

### State (REQ-AUD-mobile-state)
- **D-01, contexts.** Split the state into five memoised contexts: session, status, sync actions, surveys and form.
  - One central hook, called once in `App.tsx`, fills all five. Keeping a single call preserves the 01.5 single-sync guarantees and the owner-check flow.
  - Callbacks are stable, built with `useCallback` or a ref-backed action object. That includes the debug-reset handlers.
  - Screens read the context they need directly instead of receiving 24 props.
  - The hook tests that spy on React (`useSurveySync.test.ts` and 9 others) are rewritten with `renderHook` first.
- **D-02 (Claude), proving criterion 1.** A committed Jest render-count test stands in for the React DevTools "before/after profile". It is Claude-verifiable, and the owner no longer does manual profiling.
  - The test mounts the navigation tree with its tabs and counts renders per screen and per list row, first on a status update and then on a form keystroke.
  - It runs on the pre-phase code first and records the "before" numbers. The "after" numbers go in VALIDATION.md.

### Lists, screens, navigation
- **D-03, survey list.**
  - The survey list becomes a `FlatList` with memoised rows.
  - Completion is computed when the survey is written and stored in a new `local_surveys` column (SQLite `user_version` migration 2, written at the four write sites, with "submitted = 100" applied in SQL).
  - `listLocalSurveys` stops parsing every payload.
  - Fix the `DraftCard` bug that treats the 0–100 completion value as 0–1.
  - A render or perf test must show the list stays fluid with 500 surveys.
- **D-04, screens and navigation.**
  - No screen file over 400 lines. Split screens into subcomponents under the same feature folder.
  - Styles move next to each screen, and the ~301 unused style keys are deleted. A committed script counts unused keys and must report 0.
  - Navigation is typed through the global `ReactNavigation.RootParamList`, with no `useNavigation() as any`.

### Tabs (owner decision)
- **D-08, tabs.**
  - Both libraries stay: `react-native-bottom-tabs` draws the native iOS bar and `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` draws Android.
  - On iPhone the native "liquid glass" bar is always used in Release. The JS fallback is kept only for Expo Go / unsupported runtimes.
  - Investigate and fix why the Release build fell back to the JS bar (see the STATE todo, which the owner reported on 2026-09-25). Check `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS` and the `Constants.executionEnvironment` / `appOwnership` detection.
  - The separate "Recherche" tab is removed. Search becomes the native iOS search bar in the header of "Mes Relevés", giving 4 native tabs (Accueil, Mes Relevés, Explorer, Compte) and one survey stack.
  - Tab-bar behaviour is identical in the native and JS trees. For example, the bar is hidden on parcel selection in both.

- **D-13 (Claude, from pattern map C-3, C-6 and C-7).**
  - **Hiding the tab bar in the native tree.** `@bottom-tabs/react-navigation` only has a navigator-level `tabBarHidden`, so the native tree sets it from the focused route. Both trees share one pure, unit-tested rule, `shouldHideTabBar(focusedRouteName)`, which returns true on `surveyParcels`. No modal redesign.
  - **Removing the search tab** touches `RootTabParamList` and the four maps keyed on it (C-6).
  - **Native-tabs availability.** The check returns a reason code and logs it (C-7), so the next Release build says why it fell back.

### Map
- **D-05, map.**
  - **API:** `GET /v1/public/map-items` accepts an optional `bbox`, filtered on the 01.7 centroid columns and index. Without `bbox` the response is identical to today's. The new E2E test goes in a new spec, `public-map-bbox.e2e-spec.ts`, not in the idempotency spec that 01.8 will split.
  - **Mobile, loading:**
    - The map loads by viewport and debounces region changes (about 400 ms).
    - It stops re-centring on every load, which would otherwise cause a load/move/load loop.
    - Markers are memoised.
  - **Mobile, clustering:** use `supercluster@9.1.0` (owner approved the package on 2026-09-26 in the plan-phase questions, so no further legitimacy checkpoint is needed; the executor still runs `npm view` and stops if the repository or maintainer differs from github.com/mapbox/supercluster). It is JavaScript-only, so there is no native rebuild. It is ESM-only, so Jest needs a `moduleNameMapper` to its dist bundle.

### Text and accessibility (REQ-AUD-i18n-a11y)
- **D-06, text.**
  - A typed French catalogue object, with no i18n library and no new native dependency. PROJECT.md locks "French only, i18n in place".
  - Every user-facing string comes from the catalogue.
  - Status messages carry no ids, error codes or technical text.
  - The survey detail "Debug" tab only shows in `__DEV__` builds.
  - The iOS permission strings in `app.json` are in French.
  - An ESLint gate built from the installed rules forbids hard-coded JSX text in `mobile/src/screens` and components.
- **D-07, accessibility.**
  - Every `Pressable` in the survey detail, survey form (and its components file) and map screens gets `accessibilityRole` and `accessibilityLabel` from the catalogue.
  - An ESLint gate enforces this in those folders.

### Hygiene (REQ-AUD-hygiene)
- **D-09, removals.**
  - Remove from the repo root: `App.tsx`, the root runtime dependencies and the Expo root tsconfig.
  - API: remove `bcryptjs` and `@nestjs/schedule`.
  - API, owner decision: remove `EmailService`, `nodemailer` and the `SMTP_*` settings. That covers the config schema, the env examples, `check-env.sh`, where `SMTP_*` becomes an "obsolete" INFO line, and the docs. The API production rules are otherwise unchanged.
  - Move `@expo/ngrok` to `devDependencies`.
  - Only one plan at a time changes `package-lock.json`.
  - Before and after, run `expo-modules-autolinking resolve` and `react-native-config` to prove the set of linked native modules is unchanged.
- **D-10 (owner), native builds in CI.**
  - Add a GitHub Actions job that builds Android (`expo prebuild` + gradle `assembleRelease` or `assembleDebug`, unsigned) on Ubuntu.
  - Add a job that builds iOS for the simulator (unsigned) on macOS.
  - The repo is public, so these minutes are free.
  - Both jobs are wired into CI OK. They may be path-filtered to `mobile/**` and root package files.

### 01.8 dependency split
- **D-12, what waits for 01.8.** These three items go in a closing plan, `01.9-ZZ`, that runs after 01.8 and is marked blocked until then:
  1. The final CLAUDE.md and technical docs sweep.
  2. The audit report's "Statut" links for the 01.8 and 01.9 findings.
  3. The French messages for IBP validation errors, if 01.8 changes their shape.

  The audit "Statut" rows for phases 01.2 to 01.7 (PRs #127–#157) are written now.

### Owner involvement
- **D-11 (owner): one short device check at the end of this phase.** Everything else is verified by Claude, per the STATE decision of 2026-09-25.
  - Before the check, the owner runs `grep NATIVE_TABS mobile/.env` and removes any leftover `=false`.
  - Then the owner makes a Release build on the iPhone (`npx expo run:ios --device --configuration Release`) and checks:
    - the liquid glass bar with 4 tabs;
    - each tab opens;
    - search works in Mes Relevés;
    - the offline cold start pending since phase 01.5, criterion 7: put the phone in airplane mode, kill the app, reopen it, and the surveys are there.
  - The phase-gate plan presents this in simple French, in at most 6 steps.

### Claude's Discretion
- The exact folder layout for contexts and the catalogue (`mobile/src/state/`, `mobile/src/i18n/`), plus coverage-threshold rows for any new top-level folders.
- The cluster radius, the debounce delay and the FlatList tuning numbers.
- The exact CI job names and caching.
