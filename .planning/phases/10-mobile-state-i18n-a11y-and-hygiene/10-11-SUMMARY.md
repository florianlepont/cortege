  - "queueAttachmentAsset takes the survey name from its callers, which already look the survey up"
  - "updateSurveyVisibility's English message is no longer shown; the hook maps queued/not queued to visibilityQueuedLoginRequired / visibilityUnchanged (the hook always passes an empty token, so only those two storage branches are reachable)"
  - "Server text from submitSurvey, changeMyEmail and requestPasswordReset is logged, not shown; the user gets a generic catalogue message (the hooks do not distinguish error kinds beyond auth and owner gate)"

# Phase 01.9 Plan 11: Survey operations and profile status texts on the French catalogue Summary

The survey-operations and profile sync hooks now take every status line and Alert text from `fr.status.surveyOps` and `fr.status.profile`. No message contains a survey id, attachment id, server text or raw error text; that detail goes to `logStatusDetail` (dev builds only).

## Results

| Check | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `literals` scanner, useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts | 49 | 0 |
| `literals` scanner, useSurveySyncProfile.ts | 33 | 0 |
| `status-ids` scanner, useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts | 31 | 0 |
| `status-ids` scanner, useSurveySyncProfile.ts | 5 | 0 |
| `test(` count, useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts | 43 | 49 |
| `test(` count, useSurveySyncProfile.test.ts | 18 | 19 |
| `spyOn(React` in both tests | 0 | 0 |

The whole-app counts are now `status-ids` 30 (baseline 66) and `literals` 547 (baseline 635; other wave-2 plans also contribute).

Existing test cases are unchanged except for their asserted strings, which now compare with catalogue values. The only other change is a `console.debug` spy in `beforeEach`/`afterEach` that keeps `logStatusDetail` output out of the test logs. New cases:
- Survey ops: raw error logged and kept out of the status (id and error text absent), missing-fields details, expired / nothing-named readiness, rejected submit without server text, failed readiness check, visibility queued while signed out.
- Profile: raw password-reset error logged and kept out of the status.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 62 suites and 818 tests pass, and the thresholds pass. Line coverage is 91.4% for useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts, 72.2% for useSurveySyncProfile.ts, and 100% for both catalogue files.
- The survey-sync and i18n suites pass: 7 suites, 142 tests. The catalogue walker also checks the new entries for emptiness and id patterns.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `prettier --check` on the 6 files are clean.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written. The decisions above record the calls the plan left open.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Commits

- 3fc7cbf feat(01.9-11): move survey operation status texts to the French catalogue
- a0787ff feat(01.9-11): move profile status and alert texts to the French catalogue

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All 6 modified files exist, and commits 3fc7cbf and a0787ff are in `git log`.
