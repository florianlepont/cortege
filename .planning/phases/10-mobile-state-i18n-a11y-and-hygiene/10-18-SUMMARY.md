# Phase 01.9 Plan 18: Per-screen route components and a data-free navigation tree Summary

Each routed screen now has a memoised route component in `mobile/src/navigation/routes/` that reads only the contexts its screen shows. The navigation tree passes no data and reads only the session and stable action objects. A status update now re-renders the Settings screen alone, and a keystroke re-renders only the three form screens. Neither touches a list row.

## What was built

**`navigation/types.ts`**
- The param lists moved here from `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx`, along with `FormMode`.
- It also exports typed route props: `CompositeScreenProps` of the stack screen and the root tabs, so Home can navigate to other tabs without `as any`.
- `useEditingDraft.ts`, `AppStateProvider.tsx` and `surveys-context.ts` now import `FormMode` from here.

**Route components.** Each is `memo`, and every callback passed to a screen is stable: a context action, or a `useLatestCallback` wrapper when it also navigates.

| Route | Contexts read |
|---|---|
| SettingsRoute | status (the only `useStatus()` reader), session, sync actions |
| AccountRoute | session, `useAccessToken()` (the only reader, T-01.9-31) |
| HomeRoute | session, surveys, nearby parcels, sync actions |
| SurveyListRoute | surveys, sync actions. It also owns the header search bar (`setOptions` with `headerSearchBarOptions`) and the text-sync effect that used to live in the stack navigator |
| SurveyDetailRoute | session (apiUrl), surveys, sync actions. It renders `null` until a survey is selected, as before |
| SurveyFormRoute | session (apiUrl), form. It sets the create/edit title itself |
| FactorDetailRoute | form |
| ParcelSelectionRoute | session (apiUrl), form |
| PublicMapRoute | session (apiUrl), surveys (`ownSurveyIds`), sync actions. It also calls `usePublicMapExplorer` |

**`AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx`** went from 1,066 lines to 544.
- It keeps the navigators, options, icons and listeners.
- Render callbacks return `<XRoute {...props} />`.
- `useTabListenerDeps()` reads `useSession()` (for `isAuthenticated`), `useSyncActions()`, `useSurveyActions()` and the reload signal.
- `grep -c "useSurveys()\|useSurveyFormState()\|useStatus()"` returns 0.
- The surveys stack's `beforeRemove` listener calls `useSurveyActions().closeSurveyDetailSelection`.
- **Tab listeners.** They behave as before:
  - Mes Relevés pulls changes if signed in.
  - Explorer closes the detail selection and requests a map reload.
  - Compte closes the detail selection and loads the profile silently if signed in.

**`public-map-reload.ts`**
- `createPublicMapReloadSignal()` has `request()` and `subscribe()`.
- A request made with no subscriber stays pending and is delivered once, when the map route subscribes.
- The tree creates one signal with `useState` and provides it through `PublicMapReloadContext`.

**AppStateProvider additions** (plan: "list additions in the SUMMARY")
1. `SurveyActionsContext` / `useSurveyActions()`. Its value is the same stable `surveyActions` object as in the surveys value.
2. `NearbyParcelsContext` / `useNearbyParcelsState()` → `{ state, load }`. `load` is a `useLatestCallback`. `nearbyParcels` and `loadNearbyParcels` were removed from the form context.
3. `SurveyFormState` gains `formMode` and `editingSurveyId`, copied from the assembler state.

**`SurveyFormScreen`** no longer has the `status` prop.

## Render counts

The before numbers are in `10-render-counts-before.json` (pre-phase, unchanged through 01.9-09). The after numbers below were measured with `RENDER_COUNTS_OUT` and are pinned in `EXPECTED`.

Before:

| Scenario | home | surveyList | surveyDetail | surveyForm | factorDetail | parcelSelection | publicMap | account | settings | rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| initialMount | 2 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 19 |
| statusUpdate | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |
| formKeystroke | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |
| formKeystrokeAutosave | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 38 |
| oneSurveyRefresh | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |

After (01.9-18):

| Scenario | home | surveyList | surveyDetail | surveyForm | factorDetail | parcelSelection | publicMap | account | settings | rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| initialMount | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 19 |
| statusUpdate | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **1** | **0** |
| formKeystroke | 0 | 0 | 0 | **1** | **1** | **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| formKeystrokeAutosave | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 19 |
| oneSurveyRefresh | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 19 |

- **statusUpdate** matches the target exactly: `{ settings: 1, others: 0, rows: 0 }`. The plan's node check on the JSON passes.
- **formKeystroke:**
  - `surveyForm`, `factorDetail` and `parcelSelection` are each 1. The plan allows factorDetail and parcelSelection to be 0 or 1, and they re-render because they read the form value.
  - Every non-form screen and `rows` are 0.
- **formKeystrokeAutosave:**
  - The form screens are at 1, from the keystroke alone.
  - Screens that read the surveys context re-render once for the written survey: home, list, detail and map.
  - account and settings dropped to 0.
  - rows dropped from 38 to 19.
- **oneSurveyRefresh:** the form, account and settings screens dropped to 0. The screens that read surveys and the 19 rows remain, and 01.9-22 handles those with row memo and structural sharing.
- **initialMount:** screens that do not read the surveys list now render once instead of twice.
- Every change is a decrease.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 70 suites and 916 tests pass, and every threshold holds. The new `./src/navigation/` row is set at 100 / 96 / 100 / 100, the measured floor. `./src/state/` is at 95.6 / 76.9 / 88 / 97.9, above its row.
- New tests:
  - `routes.test.tsx` has 15 tests. They cover every route's props and navigation callbacks, including the failure paths. They cover the native search-bar options and text sync, and the map reload both on a press before mount and after mount.
  - `public-map-reload.test.ts` has 3 tests.
  - `contexts.test.tsx` has 3 new tests: the two new hooks throw outside the provider, and the form value mirrors the form mode. It also checks that the nearby value keeps its identity on a status update or a keystroke, and that `useSurveyActions()` is the same object as `useSurveys().actions`.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (66 warnings, none from this plan).
- `npm run typecheck`: passes.
- `npm run format:check`: passes.
- `npx expo export --platform ios` bundles 1,453 modules.
- The acceptance greps pass:
  - 9 route files;
  - `useStatus` only in SettingsRoute;
  - `useAccessToken()` only in AccountRoute;
  - 0 `useSurveys()/useSurveyFormState()/useStatus()` in the navigation file;
  - 1 `'./src/navigation/'` row.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 2] Nearby parcels in their own context**
- **Found during:** Task 1.
- **Issue:** HomeScreen needs `nearbyParcels`, which lived in the form value. Reading the form context from HomeRoute would re-render Home on every keystroke, which the plan counts as a failure.
- **Fix:** moved it to a narrow `NearbyParcelsContext`, following the access-token precedent.
- **Commit:** 49d7a5d

**2. [Rule 3] Actions-only surveys context**
- **Issue:** the navigator listeners (`beforeRemove`, Explorer and Compte tab presses) need `closeSurveyDetailSelection`. `useSurveys()` would subscribe the navigator to the whole surveys value.
- **Fix:** added `useSurveyActions()`. The form routes do not need it after deviation 3.
- **Commit:** 49d7a5d

**3. `formMode` / `editingSurveyId` added to the form value**
- **Why:** SurveyFormRoute needs them. Adding them to the form value keeps the form routes on a single context, so a list refresh no longer re-renders the form screens (oneSurveyRefresh went from 1 to 0 for all three).
- **Commit:** 49d7a5d

**4. Explorer reload through a signal, not `getParent().addListener("tabPress")`**
- **Issue:** with lazy tabs, the first Explorer press happens before PublicMapRoute exists, so a route-level `tabPress` listener would miss it. Before this plan, that first press loaded the map.
- **Fix:** the tab listener calls `publicMapReload.request()`, and the request stays pending until the route subscribes. The behaviour is identical, including going to the map from Home's "Explorer" link, which never loaded the map before and still does not.
- **Commit:** 80b5af0

**5. The Task 1 commit includes a minimal patch to AuthenticatedAppNavigation**
- It switches to the nearby-parcels context and drops `status=`, so the Task 1 commit type-checks on its own.
- The full rewrite is in Task 2.

**6. [Environment] node_modules symlinks**
- The worktree has no `mobile/node_modules` or `api/node_modules`, and `tsc` could not resolve the navigation and Expo types.
- I added untracked symlinks to the main checkout's folders for the checks. They were never staged and are removed at the end.

## Threat model

- **T-01.9-31:** `useAccessToken()` is called in `AccountRoute.tsx` only (checked with grep). No other route or the tree reads the token.
- **T-01.9-32:**
  - Each tab has one listener, as before. They call the same stable actions (`handlePullChanges`, `handleLoadMyProfile`, `closeSurveyDetailSelection`).
  - The map reload is one subscription per mounted map route, and it is removed on unmount (tested).
  - The single assembler is unchanged, and the owner-gate and logout-purge suites pass in the full run.

## Known Stubs

None.
