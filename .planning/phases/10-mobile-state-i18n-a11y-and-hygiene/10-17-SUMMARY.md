# Phase 01.9 Plan 17: Small screens and shared labels on the catalogue Summary

The Settings, Factor detail, Parcel selection, Profile setup and Owner conflict screens now read every visible text, text prop and alert from their `fr.*` sections, and the shared domain labels (regions, vegetation stages, factor titles/help/hints, photo preview messages, survey status badges) come from one French table.

## What was built

- **Five catalogue sections filled**: `settings` (sections, buttons, three alerts), `factorDetail` (hero, observations panel, field labels, help toggle), `parcelSelection` (singular/plural count functions), `profileSetup`, `ownerConflict` (body built by `body({ summary, email })`).
- **Translations**: Factor detail, Parcel selection and Profile setup were in English; they are now in French (for example "Get started" is now "Commencer" and "Done" is now "Terminé").
- **Accessibility**: the "Que relever" help toggle `Pressable` in FactorDetailScreen now has `accessibilityRole="button"`, a catalogue label and `accessibilityState.expanded`.
- **fr.labels**: `regions`, `vegetationStages`, `factorTitles`, `factorHelp`, `factorInputHints`, `attachmentPreview`. Values were copied verbatim from the old modules, so displayed text is unchanged. `REGION_OPTIONS`, `VEGETATION_STAGE_OPTIONS_BY_REGION`, `FACTOR_TITLES`, `HELP_BY_FACTOR`, `FACTOR_INPUT_HINTS_BY_FACTOR` and the three `*_PHOTO_MESSAGE` exports keep their names, and every `value` is unchanged (T-01.9-30).

## Verification

- Task 1 gates for the five screens: `literals` 0, `unused-styles` 0, `long-files` 0; `npx eslint … --max-warnings 0` clean.
- Task 2 gate: `literals` for the four label modules is 0 (it was 9, all in vegetation.ts).
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 62 suites, 816 tests pass, and the thresholds hold.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` exit 0. `prettier --check` passes on all 18 changed files.
- `git diff mobile/src/app/ibp-scoring.ts mobile/src/app/types.ts` is empty.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 3 - Blocking] Mocked `react-native` in survey-logic.test.ts.** The new label tests import `app/constants.ts`, which reads `Platform`. The unit Jest config cannot parse `react-native`, so the test mocks `Platform.select`. The change is test-only. Commit b21b457.
2. **Status labels read `fr.common.surveyStatus` instead of `fr.labels`.** Plan 01.9-05 created `common.surveyStatus` for `survey-logic.ts`, so the labels are not copied into `fr.labels`. The tests compare against the catalogue values and still assert the literal French strings.
3. **[Rule 2] Help toggle a11y.** The FactorDetail `Pressable` got a role, label and expanded state, as the task action requires for Pressables that lack them.

No other deviations. The factor help and hint texts are still missing their accents (for example "Diversite", "releve"). They were moved unchanged to keep the "same value" behaviour. Fixing them is a content change that the owner should approve.

## TDD Gate Compliance

- Task 2: RED aac538d (the suites failed to compile against the empty `fr.labels`), then GREEN b21b457.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Commits

- 8cad038 feat(01.9-17): move five small screens' text to the French catalogue
- aac538d test(01.9-17): add failing tests for shared labels read from the catalogue
- b21b457 feat(01.9-17): read shared domain labels from fr.labels

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All 18 modified files exist, and commits 8cad038, aac538d and b21b457 are in `git log`.
