# Phase 01.9 Plan 28: Public map on viewport loading, clusters and memoised markers Summary

The public map now loads the visible bbox 400 ms after the region settles, clusters markers with supercluster, and fits the camera only on the first load or after a filter apply, so the load/move/load loop is gone. The 754-line screen is now about 200 lines plus six parts under `screens/public-map/`, all under 400 lines. Every text comes from `fr.publicMap`, and every Pressable has a role and a catalogue label.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commits |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| 1 | Viewport hook and memoised markers (TDD) | c8d7ebd (RED), a68600e (GREEN) |
| 2 | Split the map screen, French text and accessibility | 1407d2c |
| 3 | Architecture and user-story docs, full checks | 99d1f00 |

## What was built

**`useMapViewport`** (198 lines, can be tested without MapView):
- `onRegionChangeComplete(region, details)` keeps the current region when the new one is nearly equal (`areRegionsNearlyEqual`). A programmatic move that ends where the camera already is does not trigger a reload.
- `debouncedRegion = useDebouncedValue(region, 400)`. On each change it reports the bbox (`onViewportBboxChange`) and calls `loadPublicMap({ bbox })` through a latest-callback, so typing in a filter does not reload.
- Parcels use the same debounced region: they load from zoom 15 when the layer is shown, with the existing zoom+bbox key dedupe. The key is reset when the layer is hidden.
- Fit:
  - The fit is armed at mount with the items baseline. The first completed load (a new `items` array) fits once through `fitOnce`, or only disarms if that load is empty.
  - `isGesture === true` disarms the fit, so a late first load does not pull the camera away from the user.
  - `applyFilters()` re-arms the fit and loads with `{ force: true }` (no bbox).
  - `reload()` loads `{ bbox, force: true }` and the parcels, without fitting.
- `moveTo` is used for locate and for cluster zoom. `regionForZoom` builds the region whose `computeRegionZoom` equals the cluster's expansion zoom. `computeRegionFromItems` moved here from the screen.

**Markers:**
- `memo(SurveyMarker)`: props `{ id, coordinate, ibpTotal, selected, onSelect(id) }`. Its accessibility label is `fr.publicMap.a11y.surveyMarker(ibp)`. The selected marker uses a terracotta pin at zIndex 3.
- `memo(ClusterMarker)`: `tracksViewChanges={false}`, a bubble showing the count (capped at "99+"), and the label `fr.publicMap.a11y.cluster(count)`.
- Both use value comparators on the coordinate.

**Screen parts:**
- `MapCanvas`: `useMapClusters({ items, region })`. A cluster press calls `resolveClusterPress`: `zoom` animates to `regionForZoom(center, zoom, region)`, and `leaves` opens the list (Pitfall 7).
- `MapControls`: `MapTopControls` (badge, count, filter toggle, refresh, filter panel with the layer toggle) and `MapBottomDock` (empty bubble, locate).
- `SelectedSurveyCard`: owns the report form state and is mounted with `key={survey_id}`.
- `ClusterListSheet`: memo rows whose press reports the id.
- `styles.ts`: `screenStyles`, `controlStyles`, `panelStyles`, `markerStyles`. The three identical round-button blocks are merged, and the empty `reportCancelButton`/`reportSubmitButton` keys are dropped.

**Route:** `PublicMapRoute` stores the last bbox the screen reported. Tab-press reloads call `loadPublicMap({ bbox, force: true })`. The pending press that mounted the route is sent with `force: false`. Closing the survey detail selection on a tab press is unchanged (`makePublicMapTabListeners`).

## Verification

- Plan gates for `src/screens/PublicMapScreen.tsx src/screens/public-map`: `long-files` 0, `unused-styles` 0 and `literals` 0. `npx eslint … --max-warnings 0` is clean, including the D-07 Pressable rule and `PublicMapRoute.tsx`.
- `animateToRegion`: the only call on the map ref is the screen's `animateToRegion` wrapper. It is reached only through `fitOnce` (first load or filter apply) and `moveTo` (explicit locate and cluster-zoom actions).
- Targeted run (`public-map|render-counts|usePublicMapExplorer|navigation`): 12 suites, 128 tests pass. The render-count harness passes with `EXPECTED` unchanged.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: **80 suites, 1,041 tests pass**, exit 0, and all thresholds hold. `screens/public-map` is at 99.18 % statements / 94.5 % branches / 100 % functions. `PublicMapScreen.tsx` is at 98.66 / 94.73 / 94.11 / 100. `fr/public-map.ts` is at 100 %.
- New tests (28): 13 in `useMapViewport.test.ts`, 6 in `markers.test.tsx`, 9 in `PublicMapScreen.test.tsx`. `routes.test.tsx` gains assertions for the force flags and the reused bbox.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (28 warnings, none in the touched files). `npm run typecheck`: passes. `npm run format:check`: passes.
- `npx expo export` from `mobile/`: Android (1,475 modules) and iOS (1,479 modules) both bundle. Both `.hbc` bundles contain `getClusterExpansionZoom`, so supercluster is now in the app bundle.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] `isGesture` does not exist on Apple Maps.** react-native-maps 1.27 documents `isGesture` as "supported by Google Maps only", so on iOS it is `undefined`. The loop protection therefore does not depend on it:
- no fit after viewport loads;
- nearly-equal regions are ignored;
- explorer dedupe.

`isGesture === true` is only used to cancel a pending first fit.

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] The report result was never visible after a successful report.** The old screen rendered `reportMessage` inside the form, and the form closes on success. The message now renders below the form.

**3. [Rule 2 - Security, T-01.9-50] The card title showed `Survey <survey_id>`.** It now shows `Relevé public · IBP <score>`. A test asserts that the id appears nowhere in the rendered tree.

**4. [Rule 2] The tab-press reload keeps the viewport.** The interface said `loadPublicMap({ force: true })`. Without a bbox, that call loads every item and discards the viewport. The route instead reuses the last bbox that the screen reported, through the new `onViewportBboxChange` prop. The press that mounted the route is not forced, so the first open sends one request instead of two.

**5. Filter apply loads without a bbox.** A region or date filter is meant to find matching surveys anywhere. The apply loads every match and fits once. Later viewport moves go back to bbox loads.

**6. Files beyond the plan list:**
- `PublicMapScreen.test.tsx`: the screen integration test, covering the new screen code.
- `routes.test.tsx`: force-flag assertions.
- The full `fr.publicMap` catalogue was committed in Task 1 because the marker labels needed it.

**7. [Environment]** For the checks, `node_modules`, `mobile/node_modules` and `api/node_modules` were symlinked to the main checkout. They were never staged and were removed at the end.

## Owner checks on device (01.9-31)

1. **iOS (Apple Maps).** Open Explorer:
   - The map fits the public surveys once.
   - Panning or zooming reloads about 0.4 s after the camera stops, and the camera does not move again by itself (no loop).
   - Watch the API log: one `GET /public/map-items?bbox=…` per settled move.
2. **Clusters:**
   - Nearby surveys show a round green bubble with a count.
   - Tapping it zooms in until the bubble splits.
   - Surveys that share a rounded location open the list at max zoom, and a row opens the survey card.
   - On Android, check that the bubble is drawn: `tracksViewChanges={false}` can leave a custom marker blank on some devices. If it does, change it to track only for the first frame.
3. **Filters:** "Appliquer les filtres" loads every matching survey and fits once. The refresh button reloads the current area without moving the camera.
4. **Explorer tab:** pressing the tab again reloads the current area, and it still closes an open survey detail.
5. **VoiceOver:** every button reads a French label, markers read "Relevé public, IBP n", and clusters read "Groupe de n relevés".

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. There is no new network surface: the bbox parameter was already covered by 01.9-23 (T-01.9-42/43).
- T-01.9-49 is mitigated by the fit rules and the debounce and dedupe, all tested.
- T-01.9-50 is mitigated by catalogue labels built from scores and counts, and a test checks that no id is shown.

## TDD Gate Compliance

Task 1 has a `test(01.9-28)` commit (c8d7ebd; the suites failed on the missing modules) followed by a `feat(01.9-28)` commit (a68600e).

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All 11 created files exist.
- Commits c8d7ebd, a68600e, 1407d2c and 99d1f00 are in `git log`.
