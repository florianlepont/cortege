# Phase 01.9 Plan 08: Precomputed survey completion Summary

SQLite migration 2 adds `local_surveys.payload_completion` (backfilled in the migration transaction, `user_version` 2). The four payload write sites store it. `listLocalSurveys` now reads completion from SQL (`CASE WHEN status = 'submitted' THEN 100 ELSE payload_completion END`) and never selects or parses `payload_json`. `DraftCard` now reads completion as 0-100.

## Tasks

| Task | Commit | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 (RED) | 2ac5d75 | Failing tests: migration from v0 and v1 fixtures, corrupt payload, idempotent re-run, four write sites, list read, 500-row no-parse proof |
| 1 (GREEN) | d415c98 | `computePayloadCompletion` split, `migration2`, `SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`, four write sites, list query |
| 2 | 88cfa5d | DraftCard fix and render test, data-contract note |

## Details

- `utils.ts`: `computePayloadCompletion(payload)` returns an integer from 0 to 100. `computeCompletionRate` is now `status === "submitted" ? 100 : computePayloadCompletion(payload)`, so the result is unchanged.
- `db.ts`: `migration2` is additive. It uses `ensureColumn` to add `payload_completion INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`, then backfills it with `safeParseJson` and `toSurveyQueuePayload`. An unparsable payload gets 0. `payload_json` is never rewritten. The baseline `CREATE TABLE` text is unchanged, so fresh installs migrate like every other install.
- Write sites: `createLocalDraft` INSERT, `updateLocalDraft` UPDATE, and the `applyRemoteChanges` INSERT and UPDATE. The 01.5 pull guard (skip on a pending queue row or `sync_blocked`) is unchanged. The objects returned by the write sites still get `completion_rate` from `computeCompletionRate`.
- The fifth `payload_json` write, `queueSurveyVisibilityChange` (`sync.ts` ~line 752), only changes `visibility`. `computePayloadCompletion` does not read that field, so no recompute is needed. A one-line comment citing 01.9 D-03 explains this.
- List consumers: grep shows `completion_rate` is the only payload-derived field in `LocalSurvey`. No other column was needed.
- `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` was checked and not edited. It does not describe the `applyRemoteChanges` column list.

## Verification

- Storage suites: 19/19 suites, 287 tests green. That includes the unchanged sync.engine, sync.pull, sync.retry and transaction suites.
- DraftCard: 4/4 tests. Against the old component, 3 fail as expected (RED checked by temporarily restoring the old file).
- Full mobile `test:unit:coverage`: 59 suites, 772 tests, exit 0. All coverage thresholds pass.
- `npm run lint`: 0. `npm run typecheck`: 0. `prettier --check` passes on every changed `.ts`/`.tsx` file.
- 500-row proof: `listLocalSurveys` on 500 seeded surveys makes 0 `JSON.parse` calls. It sends exactly one `getAllAsync`, whose SQL contains no `payload_json`. The values match the pre-change `computeCompletionRate` for every row.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Updated two existing suites that assert `user_version` 1**
- **Found during:** Task 1
- **Issue:** `db.migration-legacy.sqlite.test.ts` and `transaction.sqlite.test.ts` hard-code `user_version` 1. They would fail once `SCHEMA_VERSION` is 2.
- **Fix:** Changed the expected value to 2. No other assertion was changed. Neither file is in the plan's `files_modified`, so parallel plans touching them could see a trivial conflict.
- **Commit:** 2ac5d75

**2. [Scope note] DraftCard "label"**
- The DraftCard has no percentage text label. The `${rate}%` string is the progress bar width, and the visible label is the `N/10` factor count. The test asserts both.

**3. [Rule 2] Clamp in DraftCard**
- `completion_rate` is clamped to 0-100 (rounded) before use, as the plan's action asked. This is covered by the out-of-range test.

### TDD Gate Compliance

Task 1 has separate `test(...)` (2ac5d75) and `feat(...)` (d415c98) commits. For Task 2, the test and the fix were committed together in `fix(...)` 88cfa5d. RED was checked before committing by running the new test against the restored old component (3 of 4 tests failed).

## Known Stubs

None.
