# Phase 01.9 Plan 23: Map data layer (bbox, debounce, clusters) Summary

The public map can now load by viewport. `fetchPublicMapItems` sends an encoded `bbox`. `loadPublicMap` drops stale responses and skips requests identical to the one in flight or the last completed one. A generic `useDebouncedValue` hook and a supercluster-based `useMapClusters` hook are ready for 01.9-28 to wire into the map screen. The explorer's three status texts come from `fr.status.map`, and raw errors only go to `logStatusDetail`.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| 1 | bbox client, explorer guards and status texts | 410a14a |
| 2 | Debounced value, clustering hook and the supercluster Jest mapper | 6d65a5b |

## What was built

**API client.** `fetchPublicMapItems` accepts `bbox?: string` and appends `bbox=<encodeURIComponent>` when it is non-blank (T-01.9-43). Without it the URL is unchanged.

**Explorer (`usePublicMapExplorer`).**
- `loadPublicMap(options?: { bbox?: string; force?: boolean })`.
- `itemsRequestRef` stale guard: only the latest request sets items, status and `loading`. A stale failure is silent.
- The key is `bbox ?? "all"` plus the filters. A call with options is skipped when its key equals the pending or last completed key, unless `force` is set. A failure clears the last key, so the same viewport can be retried.
- Status: `fr.status.map.loaded({ count })`, `loadFailed()`, `parcelsLoadFailed()`, with details logged as `map.load` / `map.parcels`. `onStatusChange` is typed `StatusMessage`.
- Both scanners report 0 for the file (`literals`, `status-ids`).

**`useDebouncedValue<T>(value, delayMs)`.** A `setTimeout` in an effect on `[value, delayMs]` that is cleared on change and unmount (T-01.9-42).

**`useMapClusters({ items, region })`.**
- The index is `new Supercluster({ radius: 60, maxZoom: 16 })`, loaded from `display_location` and memoised on `items`.
- The clusters come from `getClusters(computeRegionBboxArray(region), computeClusterZoom(region))`, memoised on `[index, region]`. They are mapped to a typed `MapClusterEntry` union (`cluster` or `item`) with stable `key`s.
- The helpers are `expansionZoom(id)`, `leaves(id)` (all leaves as `PublicMapItem[]`) and `resolveClusterPress(id)`. The last returns `{ kind: "leaves", items }` when the expansion zoom exceeds 16 (Pitfall 7), and `{ kind: "zoom", zoom }` otherwise.
- `computeRegionBboxArray` (numeric, clamped) and `computeClusterZoom` live in the hook file. The file reuses `computeRegionZoom` from `app/map-viewport.ts`.

**Jest.** `'^supercluster$': '<rootDir>/../node_modules/supercluster/dist/supercluster.js'`, the root hoisting location that 01.9-19 recorded.

## Verification

- Targeted tests: `ibp-api` and `usePublicMapExplorer` pass, 27 tests. `usePublicMapExplorer.test.ts` went from 13 to 22 cases: the 13 original cases are kept, with their asserted strings swapped for `fr.status.map` values. `useDebouncedValue` has 4 tests and `useMapClusters` has 9.
- Mobile suite with coverage: 73 suites and 965 tests pass, and the thresholds hold (exit 0). `useMapClusters.ts`, `useDebouncedValue.ts` and `map.ts` are at 100 %. `usePublicMapExplorer.ts` is at 98 % of lines; the one uncovered line is the existing stale return on the parcels path.
- `render-counts.test.tsx`: 5 of 5 pass.
- `npm run lint` shows 0 errors and 62 warnings, the same count as before, with none in the touched files. `npm run typecheck` passes. `npm run format:check` passes.
- Plan checks:
  - both structure-report scanners give 0 for the explorer;
  - `grep -rln 'spyOn(React' mobile/src` finds nothing;
  - the `'^supercluster$'` and `supercluster/dist/supercluster.js` greps each return 1.
- `npx expo export` from `mobile/` bundles iOS (1247 modules) and Android (1452 modules). No screen imports `useMapClusters` yet (01.9-28 does that), so a temporary, uncommitted probe import in `index.js` checked that Metro resolves supercluster's ESM entry. The iOS bundle then contained `getClusterExpansionZoom`. The probe was reverted.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 2 - Correctness] Calls without options always fetch.** The plan says the Explorer tab press forces a reload, but this plan may not edit `PublicMapRoute.tsx`, which calls `loadPublicMap()` with no argument (the Load button does the same). Deduping those calls would silently turn both explicit reloads into no-ops. So `force` defaults to true when `options` is undefined, and viewport loads from 01.9-28 pass `{ bbox }` and get the dedupe. This is tested ("a call without options always reloads").

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] The dedupe key includes the filters.** A key of `bbox ?? "all"` alone would skip a reload after a from/to/region change on the same viewport. The key is `[bbox ?? "all", from, to, region]`. The dedupe also covers the request in flight, not only the last completed one, so two region events that settle on the same bbox send one request.

**3. [Rule 1 - Bug] Cluster zoom capped at maxZoom.** Above `maxZoom` supercluster returns raw points, which would stack surveys that share a rounded location as unreachable markers. So `computeClusterZoom` clamps to `[0, 16]`, and at 16 the cluster's press returns its leaves (Pitfall 7).

**4. [Rule 1 - Bug] Exact coordinates for single points.** Supercluster's projection round-trip returns, for example, 48.85000000000002. Item entries use `item.display_location` instead.

**5. Added `resolveClusterPress`** next to `expansionZoom` and `leaves`, so the zoom-or-list decision is unit-tested here rather than in the screen.

## Known Stubs

None. `useDebouncedValue` and `useMapClusters` are not consumed by a screen yet, by design: 01.9-28 wires them in.

## Threat Flags

None. The new surface is the bbox query parameter only, covered by T-01.9-42 and T-01.9-43.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All four created files exist. Commits 410a14a and 6d65a5b are present on the branch.
