  - "The full-screen map modal got its own part, ParcelMapModal.tsx; the step rail lives in FormHeader.tsx next to the hero"
  - "Styles split into styles.ts (shared), header.styles.ts, parcels.styles.ts and factors.styles.ts, each with a named binding the unused-styles scanner resolves"
  - "The English UI text was translated to French in the catalogue. Factor titles and region/vegetation labels stay in app/constants.ts, as the plan asked"
  - "The entry still re-exports toAddressLabel (now straight from survey-screen-helpers) to keep its export list unchanged"

# Phase 01.9 Plan 13: Survey form screen split Summary

The survey form screen was split from 1,190 lines, plus a 644-line styles file and a 167-line components file, into a 261-line entry and 14 files under `screens/survey-form/`. Fourteen unused style keys were deleted. All of the form's text now comes from `fr.surveyForm`, and all 7 Pressables have a role and a French catalogue label.

## Layout

| File | Lines | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| SurveyFormScreen.tsx | 261 | Entry: same path, `SurveyFormScreen` export and props type (`status: _status` kept for 01.9-18) |
| survey-form/FormHeader.tsx | 265 | Collapsing hero, step rail, `buildHeroCopy`, `buildStepMeta` |
| survey-form/SiteSection.tsx | ~60 | Step 1, site name |
| survey-form/ParcelsSection.tsx | ~110 | Parcel card with the inline map, selected ids and address |
| survey-form/ParcelMapModal.tsx | 150 | Full-screen parcel map |
| survey-form/RegionVegetationSection.tsx | ~55 | Region version and vegetation stage chips |
| survey-form/FactorsList.tsx | ~160 | Score summary, factor tiles, `computeFactorProgress` |
| survey-form/FormActions.tsx | ~30 | Back button and primary action row |
| survey-form/components.tsx | ~110 | `WizardStep`, `FACTOR_ORDER`, `FACTOR_ICONS`, `StepButton`, `WizardChip` |
| survey-form/useParcelMap.ts | 349 | Map region, parcel overlay, GPS locate, reverse geocode |
| survey-form/useWizardScroll.ts | ~170 | Scroll, keyboard, hero interpolations |
| survey-form/{styles,header.styles,parcels.styles,factors.styles}.ts | 103/195/187/105 | Styles next to their users |

## Verification

- The per-folder gates on `src/screens/SurveyFormScreen.tsx src/screens/survey-form` all report 0:
  - `long-files`
  - `unused-styles`
  - `literals`
  - `npx eslint … --max-warnings 0`, which also covers `src/i18n`
- The render-count harness (`src/state/render-counts.test.tsx`) passes 5/5 after Task 1.
- `src/screens/survey-form` and `src/i18n` pass 13 tests. The catalogue walker also calls every new `fr.surveyForm` function.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` passes 63 suites and 815 tests, and the thresholds hold.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` exit 0.
- `prettier --check` passes on all changed files.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **Part names adjusted, which the plan allows.**
   - The plan listed only `styles.ts`. I added `header.styles.ts`, `parcels.styles.ts` and `factors.styles.ts`.
   - I added `ParcelMapModal.tsx`, `useParcelMap.ts` and `useWizardScroll.ts`, because moving only the sections would still have left the entry well over 400 lines.
2. **[Rule 1] Small, behaviour-neutral restructuring during the move.**
   - The two copies of the GPS-locate promise chain became one `requestLocation(requestId, errorText)` helper.
   - The reset effect on `[screen, editingSurveyId]` became two effects with the same dependencies: `activeStep` in the entry and `autoLocateRequested` in the map hook.
   - The map ref callbacks became `setInlineMapInstance` and `setFullscreenMapInstance`. They have the same semantics as before.
3. **Translation.** The pre-migration text was English, with 3 French strings. Moving it to the catalogue meant translating it into French, as D-06 requires. "Back" has no entry in `fr.common`, so `surveyForm.actions.back` was added.

## Notes for later plans

- The full-screen modal (`ParcelMapModal`) cannot be opened: nothing ever sets `isParcelMapFullscreenVisible` to true, and "Plein écran" calls `onOpenParcelFullscreen`, which navigates to the parcel screen. It was kept as-is because this is a pure move. A later cleanup can delete it.
- The iOS `Button` titles in the modal come from the catalogue. `Button` has no separate accessibility label, so the title is what VoiceOver reads.

## TDD Gate Compliance

- Task 2: the RED commit a9340e2 fails on missing catalogue keys. The GREEN commit 1d40efd follows it.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Commits

- fa243f8 refactor(01.9-13): split the survey form screen into survey-form parts
- a9340e2 test(01.9-13): add failing factor tile accessibility and French text tests
- 1d40efd feat(01.9-13): French catalogue text and accessible Pressables for the survey form

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All created files exist, and both old files are deleted.
- Commits fa243f8, a9340e2 and 1d40efd are in `git log`.
