# Phase 01.9 Plan 01: Render-count harness and pre-phase baseline Summary

A Jest render-count harness mounts the real `mobile/App.tsx` with fake navigators that render every tab and stack screen at once. It pins deterministic pre-phase counts for five scenarios and writes them to `10-render-counts-before.json`, which stands in for the DevTools before/after profile (D-02).

## What was built

- `mobile/src/state/render-counts.test.tsx`:
  - The mocks sit at stable seams: `react-native` (Proxy host components plus a `FlatList`/`Animated.FlatList` that renders `initialNumToRender` rows), gesture-handler plus a `Swipeable` probe, safe-area, the four navigation packages, screen entry probes, auth session, local-data owner, storage modules, `ibp-api` (Proxy), and the Expo native modules.
  - `SurveyListScreen` is real, wrapped by a counting passthrough.
  - The storage mock returns fresh row objects on every `listLocalSurveys` call. `updateLocalDraft`/`createLocalDraft` mutate the seeded array.
  - `EXPECTED` is pinned, and each scenario asserts `toEqual`.
  - The JSON writer runs only when `RENDER_COUNTS_OUT` is set. It adds `gitHead` when `RENDER_COUNTS_GIT_HEAD` is set.
- `10-render-counts-before.json`: generated from the unchanged production tree (`gitHead` 9f2e679, the commit before the harness).
- `mobile/jest.unit.config.js`: new `'./App.tsx': { statements: 79, branches: 65, functions: 56, lines: 83 }` row at the measured floor (79.38 / 65.21 / 56.66 / 83.33).

## Baseline (pre-phase)

| Scenario | home | surveyList | surveyDetail | surveyForm | factorDetail | parcelSelection | publicMap | account | settings | rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| initialMount | 2 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 19 |
| statusUpdate | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |
| formKeystroke | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |
| formKeystrokeAutosave | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 38 |
| oneSurveyRefresh | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |

**Research expectation confirmed.** One status update and one keystroke each re-render every mounted screen and every list row. That is 8 mounted screens (`surveyDetail` only mounts once a survey is selected) and all 19 rows. The realistic keystroke path (keystroke + 900 ms autosave + list refresh with fresh rows) doubles that: every screen twice and 38 row renders. A refresh where one survey changed re-renders every screen and all 19 rows, not one row. `initialMount` has 2 renders per screen: the first with an empty list, the second after bootstrap loads the surveys.

The counts were identical over 3 consecutive runs, plus the JSON-writing run.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 1 - Plan assumption] `rows` is 19, not 20, in initialMount**
- **Found during:** Task 1
- **Issue:** The acceptance criterion expected `rows === 20` for 20 seeded surveys. `SurveyListScreen` shows the most recently updated draft as the "continue draft" card (`SurveyListScreen.tsx:351-395`), which is not a Swipeable. So the main list has 19 Swipeable rows.
- **Fix:** Kept the 20 seeded drafts and pinned the measured 19, as the plan says ("do not tune mocks"). A comment above `EXPECTED` explains it. The `initialMount` guard asserts `surveyList >= 1` and `settings >= 1`.
- **Commit:** 4b3ccf7

**2. [Rule 3 - Worktree] Baseline JSON path**
- The plan's `RENDER_COUNTS_OUT` example points at the main checkout. The JSON was written to the same relative path inside this worktree.

**Note:** `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` was already not Prettier-formatted before this plan (single quotes, semicolons), and the root `format:check` does not cover `.js` files. The new row keeps the file's existing style, as the plan asks.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 58 suites, 762 tests passed, all thresholds met.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`: green.
- `grep -c console.log mobile/src/state/render-counts.test.tsx` returns 0. There is no `jest.mock("../../App"`, and `RENDER_COUNTS_OUT` is present.

## Commits

- 2a9e94d: test(01.9-01): add render-count harness mounting the real App tree
- 4b3ccf7: test(01.9-01): pin pre-phase render counts and record baseline JSON
