# Phase 01.9 Plan 02: renderHook rewrite of four spy-based hook tests Summary

`useSurveySync`, `useNearbyParcels`, `useParcelStatuses` and `useSurveyList` tests now render the real hooks with `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-native/pure`, with no `jest.spyOn(React, …)` left, so 01.9-09 can add `useMemo`/`useContext` without breaking them.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Rewrite useSurveySync.test.ts on renderHook | 554d9ee | mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts |
| 2 | Rewrite useNearbyParcels, useParcelStatuses, useSurveyList tests | 4b8f679 | the three test files |

## Case counts (before -> after)

| File | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| useSurveySync.test.ts | 40 | 43 |
| useNearbyParcels.test.ts | 2 | 4 |
| useParcelStatuses.test.ts | 12 | 14 |
| useSurveyList.test.ts | 10 | 11 |

Every earlier behaviour assertion is kept. Many tests that used to check only "does not throw" or "resolves" now also check the rendered state:
- `status` text after success, error, AUTH_REQUIRED and silent paths;
- `surveyDetails`, `surveyEvents` and the loading ids;
- `operationStatus` after `setStatus`;
- items and loading after a debounce, a non-array payload or an error;
- filter values after `resetFilters`.

Old tests that captured internal calls were rewritten to check what can be observed:
- **"setOperationStatus updater" (captured the 2nd useState setter):** now checks that `updateOperationStatus` is called with the initial status and that `result.current.operationStatus` is the returned value.
- **"captures an effect" and "cleanup returns a function" (useParcelStatuses):** now check that the first fetch waits for the debounce, and that unmounting before the debounce means no fetch.
- **Captured-effect auto-load tests (useSurveySync):** the effects now run for real. Two tests were added for the positive auto-load paths (submitted survey detail, events tab).
- **Stale response guard (useParcelStatuses):** a new test checks that a late success and a late rejection from older requests are both ignored.

## Verification

- `grep -c "spyOn(React"` is 0 in all four files, and each file imports `@testing-library/react-native/pure` once.
- `useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` and `sync-owner-gate.test.ts` were not changed and pass (3 suites / 49 tests in the targeted run).
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 57 suites, 765 tests passed, all thresholds met. The `src/hooks` row is 88.88 statements, 75.75 branches, 90.59 functions and 90.32 lines, against floors of 85 / 69 / 83 / 87.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `prettier --check` on the four files all pass.

## Deviations from Plan

None. The plan was executed as written, and no production files were touched.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- The four modified files exist.
- Commits 554d9ee and 4b8f679 are present in `git log`.
