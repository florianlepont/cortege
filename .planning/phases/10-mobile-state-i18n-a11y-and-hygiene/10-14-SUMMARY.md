# Phase 01.9 Plan 14: Sign-in screen split Summary

The sign-in screen went from one 752-line file to an entry of 228 lines plus three parts in `screens/auth-gate/`. All of its text now comes from `fr.authGate` or `fr.common`.

## Layout

| File | Lines | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| `screens/AuthGateScreen.tsx` | 228 | Entry: same path, export name and props. Holds the intro animation, handlers, splash and the `__DEV__` config modal |
| `screens/auth-gate/HeroSection.tsx` | 209 | Hero with its blob animation constants and `makeBlobExpandStyle` |
| `screens/auth-gate/AuthPanel.tsx` | 139 | Title, error banner, the three actions and the legal footer |
| `screens/auth-gate/styles.ts` | 240 | `authStyles`, `devModalStyles` and the hero layout constants |

The unused-style scanner already reported 0 for this screen before the split, so no style keys were deleted. Each part is a pure move. The only code change is a small `openLink(url)` helper in AuthPanel that replaces three copies of the same haptic plus `Linking.openURL` lambda.

## Catalogue

`fr.authGate` has four groups: `hero`, `panel`, `legal` and `devConfig`. It holds 20 entries, including the dev-only API URL label, placeholder and hint. The close button uses `fr.common.actions.close`.

Two accessibility additions (catalogue labels):
- The forgot-password link now has `accessibilityLabel`.
- The dev-only logo Pressable now has `accessibilityRole="button"` and a label. It keeps `accessible={false}`, so VoiceOver still skips it.

## Tests

`AuthGateScreen.test.ts` has 4 tests now, up from 1:
- login wiring (kept);
- register and forgot-password each bound to their own handler, which covers T-01.9-27;
- the rendered texts and button labels equal the catalogue values;
- the login error is shown in the banner.

The react-native mock is unchanged.

## Verification

- `structure-report.js long-files | unused-styles | literals src/screens/AuthGateScreen.tsx src/screens/auth-gate --max 0`: all 0. Literals were 22 before.
- `npx eslint src/screens/AuthGateScreen.tsx src/screens/auth-gate src/i18n/fr/auth-gate.ts --max-warnings 0`: clean. There were 21 warnings before.
- `npm run typecheck` passes. `npm run lint` reports 0 errors (335 warnings elsewhere, down from 356).
- `prettier --check` passes on the changed files.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 62 suites and 814 tests pass, and the thresholds hold.

## Deviations from Plan

None. There were no dead style keys to delete: the Task 1 unused-styles gate was already at 0 for this screen.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Commits

- b0d44ce refactor(01.9-14): split the sign-in screen into auth-gate/ parts
- 929a3fc feat(01.9-14): read the sign-in screen texts from the French catalogue

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: mobile/src/screens/auth-gate/HeroSection.tsx, AuthPanel.tsx, styles.ts
- FOUND: commits b0d44ce, 929a3fc
