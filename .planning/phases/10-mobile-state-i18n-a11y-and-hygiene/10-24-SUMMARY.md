# Phase 01.9 Plan 24: Navigation split, global typing and component routes Summary

The 544-line `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx` (961 lines before 01.9-18) is gone. The navigation now lives in `mobile/src/navigation/`, split into files of at most 159 lines. Navigation is typed through the global `ReactNavigation.RootParamList`, every screen is mounted with `component=`, and `app/styles.ts` (1,528 lines) is deleted after moving its four live keys.

## What was built

**Layout (`mobile/src/navigation/`)**

| File | Lines | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `AppNavigation.tsx` | 64 | `isNativeBottomTabViewAvailable()` (unchanged), `AppTabs` with the `console.warn` fallback log, `AppNavigation` (reload-signal provider + single `NavigationContainer`) |
| `tab-config.tsx` | 159 | iOS / Android / JS icons, `TAB_TITLES`, `nativeTabScreenOptions`, `jsTabScreenOptions`, the three listener factories, `useTabListenerDeps()` |
| `tabs/NativeRootTabs.tsx` | 79 | `getNativeTabNavigator()` with the **lazy `require("@bottom-tabs/react-navigation")`** (T-01.9-44), the native tab tree |
| `tabs/JsRootTabs.tsx` | 53 | the JS tab tree, bar hidden on `surveyParcels` |
| `stacks/*Stack.tsx` | 18–118 | one stack navigator per tab, `component={XRoute}` screens, same options and `beforeRemove` listener |
| `stacks/stack-options.ts` | 23 | `baseStackScreenOptions` |
| `stacks/surveys-stack-config.ts` | 21 | `SurveysStackConfigContext` / `useSurveysStackConfig()` |
| `styles.ts` | 23 | `tabScreenContainer`, `mainScroll`, `content`, `accountScreenWrap` |
| `types.ts` | 66 | param lists + `declare global { namespace ReactNavigation { interface RootParamList extends RootTabParamList {} } }` |

- `App.tsx` imports `{ AppNavigation } from "./src/navigation/AppNavigation"`.
- The `useNavigation() as any` cast named in the plan had already been removed by 01.9-18 (HomeRoute uses typed composite props). A throwaway probe confirmed the global declaration works: `useNavigation().navigate("publicMap")` and `navigate("surveys", { screen: "surveyForm" })` compile, and `navigate("nope")` is rejected.
- The account header's `options` is now a named, typed `accountHomeOptions(props: NativeStackScreenProps<…>)` function, with the same output.
- `structure-report.js` and `mobile/.eslintrc.json` no longer mention the deleted file (the long-files rule already covers `src/navigation/`).

## Behaviour unchanged

- Same tabs (search tab still present on iOS native; 01.9-25 removes it), same options, titles, icons, listeners, `minimizeBehavior`, and the same availability check and fallback log.
- Render-count harness: `EXPECTED` unchanged and passing (5/5). The harness file was not edited; its fake Screen already handled `component=`.
- Both platform exports bundle: iOS 1,465 modules, Android 1,461 modules.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: **72 suites, 963 tests pass**, every threshold holds. `src/navigation`, `stacks` and `tabs` are at 100/100/100/100; `routes` at 100/96.42/100/100 (row is 100/96/100/100).
- New `navigation.test.tsx` (21 tests): the tree choice (Android, iOS native, the three fallbacks: env opt-out, store client, app ownership), no search tab outside iOS, the guard outside `AppNavigation`, the three tab listeners (signed in and out, in both trees), the native and JS tab options and icons, the JS bar hidden on parcel selection, the detail `beforeRemove`, the factor title, the surveys stack headers (JS and native search), the account settings button, and the platform-dependent base stack options.
- `routes.test.tsx`: the two native SurveyListRoute tests now provide the config through `SurveysStackConfigContext`.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (62 warnings, none in `src/navigation` or `App.tsx`). `npm run typecheck`: passes. `npm run format:check`: passes.
- Plan gates:
  - `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx` and `app/styles.ts` do not exist.
  - `grep -rn "as any" mobile/src/navigation`: empty.
  - `grep -c "namespace ReactNavigation" types.ts`: 1.
  - `structure-report long-files src/navigation --max 0`: 0.
  - `structure-report unused-styles src/navigation --max 0`: 0. The whole app now reports 0 unused keys (structure counts: `unusedStyleKeys: 0`).
  - `grep -rn "useNavigation() as" mobile/src`, `grep -rn "app/styles" mobile/src mobile/App.tsx` and `grep -rn "children={\|{({ navigation" mobile/src/navigation/stacks`: all empty.
  - T-01.9-44: `grep -c 'require("@bottom-tabs/react-navigation")' tabs/NativeRootTabs.tsx` = 1, and no static import of `@bottom-tabs` in `src`.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 3] Static stack config through a context**
- **Found during:** Task 2.
- **Issue:** `SurveyListRoute` took `useNativeNav` / `searchEntry` as props, which `component=` cannot pass.
- **Fix:** added `stacks/surveys-stack-config.ts`, provided by `SurveysTabNavigator` with a memoised value and read by the route. The route's behaviour is the same.
- **Commit:** b6fc8c0

**2. [Rule 2] Coverage for the moved tree**
- **Issue:** the moved code joined the `./src/navigation/` coverage row (100/96/100/100), and the render harness only mounts the Android JS tree. The row failed at 90% statements.
- **Fix:** added `navigation.test.tsx` rather than lowering the row.
- **Commit:** b6fc8c0

**3. Extra small files and edits**
- Beyond the plan's file list: `stacks/stack-options.ts`, `stacks/surveys-stack-config.ts`, `navigation.test.tsx`, `state/contexts.test.tsx` (mock path), `scripts/structure-report.js` and `.eslintrc.json` (dropped references to the deleted file).
- `PublicMapRoute.tsx` was touched only for its styles import path (plan 23 runs in parallel on the map, so expect a one-line import conflict at most).

**4. [Environment] node_modules symlinks**
- Untracked symlinks to the main checkout were used for the checks. They were never staged and are removed at the end.

## Threat model

- **T-01.9-44:** the lazy `require` is kept in `getNativeTabNavigator()` (grep above). The CI native iOS build remains the final check.
- **T-01.9-45:** `EXPECTED` is unchanged and passes, and both platform exports bundle.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Commits

- 7dcfef9 refactor(01.9-24): split the navigation file into src/navigation with global typing
- b6fc8c0 refactor(01.9-24): mount routes with component= and delete app/styles.ts

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All 12 created files exist; the 2 deleted files are gone.
- Commits 7dcfef9 and b6fc8c0 are in `git log`.
