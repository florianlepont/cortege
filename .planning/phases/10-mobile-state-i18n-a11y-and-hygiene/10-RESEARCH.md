# Phase 01.9: Mobile state architecture, i18n, accessibility and hygiene - Research

**Researched:** 2026-09-26
**Domain:** React Native 0.86 / Expo 57 render performance (React context, memoisation, `FlatList`), expo-sqlite schema migration, react-native-maps 1.27 clustering, a typed French string catalogue, React Native accessibility props, npm-workspace dependency hygiene, native-build verification without a device, documentation accuracy
**Confidence:** HIGH on the code facts. Every count below was re-measured in this session with a committed-quality script (TypeScript AST), and the file:line references were read. MEDIUM on the render-count harness design and on the CI native-build jobs: both are designed here but not yet run. LOW on the root cause of the iOS Release tab issue, which cannot be observed without a device.

## Summary

The phase is large (audit lots L18 and L19 plus the rest of L20), but mostly mechanical. The audit is stale in several places, and some roadmap wording no longer matches the code. The planner must know these facts first.

**State (criterion 1).**
- `useSurveySync` now returns **50 keys**, not about 60 (`mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts:521-570`). Phase 01.2 removed the dead auth stubs.
- The returned object is a new literal on every render and is not memoised.
- `handleDebugResetIbpData` and `handleDebugResetUserData` are not even wrapped in `useCallback` (`useSurveySync.ts:334-362`).
- Its only production consumer is `mobile/App.tsx:71`. `App.tsx` passes it whole, with `useSurveyForm` (18 keys), `useSurveyList` (34 keys) and `usePublicMapExplorer`, into `AuthenticatedAppNavigation` (`App.tsx:167-192`). That component receives **24 props**.
- Every screen is mounted through a `Screen` render callback, `{() => <X .../>}`. React Navigation documents that this bypasses its re-render optimisations.
- The consequence is worse than the audit says. A `setStatus`, **and every keystroke in the survey form**, re-renders App, all tab navigators and every mounted screen and list row, because the form state also lives in `App.tsx:48`.
- The status text itself is displayed in exactly one place, `SettingsScreen.tsx:153-155`. `SurveyFormScreen` receives it and ignores it (`status: _status`, `SurveyFormScreen.tsx:108`).

**List and screens (criterion 2).**
- The list is an `Animated.ScrollView` with `mainListSurveys.map(...)`, and each row is a `Swipeable` with inline closures (`SurveyListScreen.tsx:678`, `1019-1161`).
- Completion is computed on every read. `listLocalSurveys` selects `payload_json` and parses it for every row (`mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts:428-447`, `computeCompletionRate` in `mobile/src/storage/utils.ts:66-97`).
- **There is a live unit bug.** `completion_rate` is 0-100, but `DraftCard` (Home tab) treats it as 0-1: it computes `completion_rate * 10` factors and a `completion_rate * 100` % width (`mobile/src/components/cards/DraftCard.tsx:19,35-36`).
- Seven screen files exceed 400 lines:

  | File | Lines |
  |---|---|
  | `SurveyListScreen` | 1 772 |
  | `SurveyDetailScreen` | 1 344 |
  | `SurveyFormScreen` | 1 190 |
  | `PublicMapScreen` | 754 |
  | `AuthGateScreen` | 752 |
  | `AccountScreen` | 596 |
  | `HomeScreen` | 409 |

  In addition, `SurveyDetailScreen.styles.ts` (836) and `SurveyFormScreen.styles.ts` (644) sit in `screens/`.
- **Unused style keys are now 301, not 158.**
  - `app/styles.ts` has 267 keys, of which only **6** are used: by `AuthenticatedAppNavigation` and `App.tsx`.
  - The screen style files add 25 + 14 + 1 unused keys.
  - The 158 was true when the audit ran, before screens moved to their own style files.
- There is exactly one `useNavigation() as any`, at `mobile/src/app/AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx:607`.

**Map (criterion 3).**
- **The API cannot filter map items by bbox today.** `GET /v1/public/map-items` accepts only `from`, `to` and `region` (`api/src/surveys/dtos/public-map-items-query.dto.ts`). Only `/public/parcels/status` takes a bbox.
- Criterion 3 therefore needs a small, additive API change: an optional `bbox` on map-items, using the 01.7 `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng` index.
- The screen renders every item as a `Marker` with an inline `onPress`, and runs `onRegionChangeComplete={setMapRegion}` (`PublicMapScreen.tsx:203,218-237`).
- It also re-fits the camera whenever the items change (`PublicMapScreen.tsx:130-133`). Combined with bbox loading, that re-fit becomes a load/animate feedback loop.

**i18n and accessibility (criterion 4).**
- An AST scan finds **552 user-facing string literals** in 36 files:

  | Kind | Count |
  |---|---|
  | Status messages | 137 |
  | JSX string props | 145 |
  | Object labels | 95 |
  | JSX text | 90 |
  | `Alert` titles and bodies | 40 |
  | `Alert` buttons | 32 |
  | `Error` messages | 13 |

- About 227 are English. Almost all status messages are English, and many interpolate survey ids (e.g. `Survey ${id} is already submitted`, `Loading canonical details for ${id}`).
- The survey detail screen shows a **Debug tab in production** with raw ids, error codes and event JSON (`SurveyDetailScreen.tsx:943-947`, `1247-1320`).
- The iOS permission dialogs in `mobile/app.json` are English too.
- `Pressable` without role or label: SurveyDetail **9/9**, PublicMap **5/5**, SurveyForm **6/6** (plus 1 in `SurveyFormScreen.components.tsx`). This matches the audit exactly.
- PROJECT.md already locks "French only, with i18n in place". A typed catalogue object needs **no library**.
- The two lint gates can be built from what is already installed:
  - `react/jsx-no-literals` from the existing `eslint-plugin-react`;
  - `no-restricted-syntax` with an esquery `:has()` selector.

  Both were prototyped in this session.

**Hygiene (criterion 5).**
- The root `App.tsx` (`import App from "./mobile/App"`) is referenced nowhere except `.dockerignore`.
- The root `expo`/`react`/`react-native` dependencies only pin hoisting; the root `overrides` already do that.
- The root `tsconfig.json` only exists to extend `expo/tsconfig.base`.
- `bcryptjs` and `@nestjs/schedule` have zero imports. `EmailService` (`api/src/users/email.service.ts`) is registered in no module, and `nodemailer` is used only by it.
- **Neither tab library is unused.**
  - `react-native-bottom-tabs` with `@bottom-tabs/react-navigation` renders the native iOS tab bar.
  - `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` renders Android, and the iOS fallback when `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false` (`AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx:16,126-145`; `useAppBottomTabBarHeight.ts`).
  - The criterion's "unused tab library" has no target without an owner decision.
- `@expo/ngrok` has no native code, so moving it to `devDependencies` does not change autolinking.
- The before/after proof on Linux is `expo-modules-autolinking resolve` plus `react-native-config`. Both run in this sandbox.
- Real native builds need CI: an Android `gradlew` job on ubuntu, and an iOS `xcodebuild` job on macOS. The repository is **public**, so GitHub-hosted macOS minutes cost nothing.

**Docs (criterion 6) and 01.8.**
- CLAUDE.md is wrong on:
  - the RN, Expo and maps versions;
  - Node 20+ (the engines field says 22.5+);
  - `POST /surveys/sync` (the route is `/v1/sync`);
  - `app_metadata` (the table is `local_meta`);
  - the API test convention (`api/test/*.spec.ts`);
  - the CI job list;
  - the hooks list;
  - "no Context API";
  - the API module table (`config/`, the 01.7 split services).
- Part of the final sweep depends on 01.8 (`packages/ibp-domain`, the split E2E files, the RS256 spec). The audit "Status" section needs 01.8's PR numbers.

**Primary recommendation:**
- Build now, in this order:
  1. the render-count harness and the three scanners;
  2. the state contexts;
  3. per-screen splits that also do the strings and accessibility;
  4. the map, with the API bbox param and supercluster;
  5. the hygiene work, with CI native builds.
- Defer to after 01.8 only:
  - the final CLAUDE.md and docs sweep;
  - the audit status links;
  - the catalogue entries for IBP validation messages.

## Architectural Responsibility Map

| Capability | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Session, sync, surveys, form and status state | Mobile client (React contexts at the App root) | Mobile SQLite (source of truth for surveys) | One assembler hook owns side effects. Contexts only distribute memoised slices. |
| Survey completion value | Mobile SQLite (column written at payload-write time) | Mobile storage layer (`storage/surveys.ts`, `storage/sync.ts`) | Computing it at write time removes the JSON parse from every list refresh. |
| Survey list virtualisation | Mobile client (`FlatList`, memoised rows) | — | Pure rendering concern. |
| Map items within the viewport | API (`/v1/public/map-items?bbox=`) | Database (btree on `parcels(centroid_lat, centroid_lng)`) | The server bounds the result. The client only sends the viewport. |
| Marker clustering | Mobile client (supercluster, JS only) | — | Needs the current zoom and viewport. No native module. |
| User-facing strings and status messages | Mobile client (typed `fr` catalogue, status codes) | — | The API's error codes stay technical. The client maps codes to French. |
| Accessibility roles and labels | Mobile client | — | Props on RN host components |
| Dependency hygiene | Build tooling (npm workspaces, lockfile) | Docker image, native projects | The root package stops carrying mobile runtime deps. Autolinking must be unchanged. |
| Native build verification | CI (GitHub Actions: ubuntu Android, macOS iOS) | Owner device (only the Release tab-bar check) | No device is available to Claude. |
| Documentation accuracy | Repo docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/technical/`, audit report) | — | Final sweep after 01.8 |

<user_constraints>
## User Constraints

No CONTEXT.md exists for this phase: `.planning/phases/10-mobile-state-i18n-a11y-and-hygiene/` was empty before this research. The binding scope comes from ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, PROJECT.md and STATE.md, quoted below. The planner must treat the success criteria as locked. The owner instructions in the research request are constraints.

### Locked scope (ROADMAP.md, Phase 01.9 — verbatim)

**Goal**: The app renders only what changed, reads in one language with proper accessibility, and the repository and its docs describe what is actually there.
**Depends on**: Phase 01.5, Phase 01.8

1. Session, sync and surveys state come from memoised contexts; `useSurveySync` no longer returns a new ~60-key object each render, and a status update no longer re-renders every mounted tab (React DevTools profile before/after attached).
2. The survey list is a `FlatList` with memoised rows and stays fluid with 500 surveys; completion is precomputed at write time instead of parsing every payload; no screen file exceeds 400 lines; the 158 unused style keys are gone; navigation is typed (no `useNavigation() as any`).
3. The map requests by bbox, clusters markers, memoises them and debounces region changes.
4. Every user-facing string comes from a French i18n catalogue, status messages carry no ids or technical text, and every `Pressable` in the survey detail, survey form and map screens has an accessibility role and label.
5. The root `App.tsx`, the root runtime dependencies and the Expo-flavoured root tsconfig are gone; `bcryptjs`, `@nestjs/schedule` and the unused tab library are removed and `@expo/ngrok` is a dev dependency, with native iOS and Android builds still passing.
6. `CLAUDE.md` and the technical docs match the final state (versions, `/v1/sync`, `local_meta`, test conventions, CI steps, new modules), and the audit report links each finding to the PR that closed it.

### Requirement definitions (REQUIREMENTS.md:135-137, verbatim)

- **REQ-AUD-mobile-state** — Memoised contexts replace the prop funnel; the survey list is virtualised; completion is precomputed; screens are split under 400 lines; unused styles are removed; navigation is typed; the map requests by bbox and clusters markers. *(Audit ARCH-4 and mobile efficiency findings. Lot L18)*
- **REQ-AUD-i18n-a11y** — Every user-facing string comes from a French i18n catalogue, status messages are user-facing, and interactive elements carry accessibility roles and labels. *(Audit i18n and accessibility findings. Lot L19)*
- **REQ-AUD-hygiene** — Root package, tsconfig and unused dependencies cleaned up; `CLAUDE.md` and technical docs match the code; the audit links each finding to its closing PR. *(Audit ARCH-7, ARCH-8. Remainder of lot L20)*

### Locked decisions carried in

- PROJECT.md:172: "The app ships in French only, with i18n in place so other languages are a translation task". This answers the remediation plan's open decision 4 (FR only). The catalogue must be typed so a second language is a translation task, but no second catalogue is built.
- STATE.md, 2026-09-25: owner device checks are delegated to Claude. "Only checks that genuinely need a phone UI go back to the owner, and they must be explicitly justified."
- Owner instructions for this research:
  - Claude verifies through unit and render tests, a render-count harness in Jest, `expo export`, expo-doctor and bundle checks.
  - Anything that needs a native build or a device is flagged, with the smallest owner step or a CI alternative.
  - 01.8 is not done. 01.9 is planned first. Independent work goes now, dependent pieces are deferred.

### Carried-in items (STATE.md pending todos)

- **Investigate iOS Release build navigation.** It belongs **partly** in this phase:
  - This phase rewrites `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx`, where both tab navigators and the `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS` escape hatch live (`:126-135`).
  - The tab-library decision in criterion 5 is the same code.
  - Commit `fb22c7b` (#119) shows the escape hatch was set to `false` during the SDK 57 tab debugging. So a leftover `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false` in the owner's `mobile/.env` is the most likely cause of "JS tab bar in Release".
  - The code-side work is in scope: make the choice explicit and logged, and add a CI Release build.
  - The device confirmation, and the carried-over 01.5 offline cold-start check, genuinely need a phone. They go to the owner as one justified step, or to the next corrective release (Open Question 4).
- The MinIO image todo and the cursor todo were closed by 01.7. They are not in scope.

### Audit-plan items in L18–L20 that the criteria do not name

The planner should include these. They belong to the same lots, and each one is small.
- Split `styles.ts` per screen (L18). `app/styles.ts` is 267 keys, of which 6 are used, so it effectively disappears.
- An ESLint accessibility rule as a warning, and a "no hard-coded text" rule limited to screens (L19). Both can be built with installed tooling (see Don't Hand-Roll).
- Remove `EmailService`, or register it if it is planned soon (L20, ARCH-7). This needs owner confirmation (Open Question 2).
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` (ARCH-7) is already gone since 01.7. Verify only.

### Dependency and non-scope

- Depends on 01.5, which is complete. It keeps these invariants that the context split must not break:
  - the single-flight drain;
  - the `syncActivity` tracker (WR-08);
  - the owner gate `syncAllowed`.
- Formally depends on 01.8, which is not started. See the next section for the precise split.
- Out of scope:
  - the species work;
  - the offline map (Phase 4);
  - `expo-image` thumbnails (done in 01.5);
  - React Compiler adoption (see State of the Art);
  - a second language.

</phase_requirements>

## Dependency on Phase 01.8: what waits and what does not

01.8 will:
- add `packages/ibp-domain` as a workspace, with the factor keys, allowed sets, `computeScores`, `validateDraft`/`validateSubmit` and the sync contract types;
- make `mobile/src/app/ibp-scoring.ts` and `mobile/src/app/types.ts` import it;
- test the RS256 path;
- split `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` into `surveys-submit`, `surveys-visibility`, `public-map`, `attachments` and `parcel-history`.

| 01.9 item | Depends on 01.8? | Why | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contexts, `useSurveySync` as an assembler, render-count harness | No | Touches `App.tsx`, `hooks/`, `app/AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx`. 01.8 touches `app/ibp-scoring.ts` and `app/types.ts` only. | Now |
| `FlatList`, memoised rows, screen splits, styles per screen, unused keys | No | Screens do not import IBP rules directly. They receive scores and readiness from hooks. | Now |
| Completion column (SQLite migration 2) | No | `computeCompletionRate` uses `FACTOR_KEYS`/`LEGACY_DEFAULT_FACTOR_VALUES` from `storage/db.ts`, which are storage concerns. The payload field names are the sync contract, which 01.8 moves but does not rename. | Now |
| Typed navigation | No | Local to navigation | Now |
| Map bbox (API + mobile), clustering, debouncing | No, but **put the new E2E in a new file** | 01.8 splits `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` and creates `public-map.e2e-spec.ts`. Adding bbox cases to the old catch-all file would conflict. | Now, as `api/test/public-map-bbox.e2e-spec.ts` |
| Catalogue for UI text, alerts, status codes, a11y | No | UI strings only | Now |
| Catalogue for **IBP validation messages** (`useSurveyForm` `requiredError`/`numberError`, submit readiness) | **Yes, partly** | If 01.8's `validateDraft`/`validateSubmit` return codes (recommended there), the French text must key on those codes. Readiness already returns codes (`ibp-scoring.ts:308-352`). | Build the catalogue section keyed on today's field and code names. Re-check after 01.8 and adapt the keys if 01.8 changes the error shape. |
| Remove root `App.tsx`, root runtime deps, root `tsconfig.json` | No (textual overlap only) | 01.8 edits root `package.json` `workspaces` and may add a `tsconfig.base.json`. Both are additive, and a merge conflict on `package.json`/`package-lock.json` is resolved by re-running `npm install`. | Now, but **never in parallel** with 01.8 lockfile work |
| Remove `bcryptjs`, `@nestjs/schedule`, `EmailService`/`nodemailer`; `@expo/ngrok` to devDeps | No (lockfile overlap only) | Same as above | Now, one lockfile-touching plan at a time |
| Tab-library decision + CI native builds | No | — | Now |
| CLAUDE.md and `docs/technical/*` **final** sweep (versions, `/v1/sync`, `local_meta`, test conventions, CI steps, `StorageService`, contexts, **`ibp-domain`**) | **Yes** | The "new modules" item names `ibp-domain`. The test conventions change with the E2E split and the RS256 spec. The Dockerfile and CI change with the package. | Two passes. Correct the facts that are already true as each change lands, in the same PR. Do the final sweep after 01.8 merges. |
| Audit report "Statut" section linking each finding to its PR | **Yes** | ARCH-1, T6, RS256 and T5 close in 01.8 with a PR number that does not exist yet. So do the 01.9 findings. | Generate the table for phases 01.2–01.7 now (script, see Pattern 12). Complete the 01.8 and 01.9 rows last. |

**Sequencing proposal:**
1. Execute 01.9 waves 0–4 now. Keep the doc edits that describe each change in the same PR.
2. Execute 01.8.
3. Run a short 01.9 closing plan ("wave 5"):
   - the final CLAUDE.md and docs sweep;
   - the audit Statut table completed with the 01.8/01.9 PRs;
   - the validation-message catalogue re-keyed if 01.8 changed the error shape;
   - `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` refreshed.

   The phase is verified after that plan.

## Project Constraints (from CLAUDE.md)

- npm workspaces monorepo (`mobile`, `api`). Native `ios/` and `android/` are generated by `expo prebuild` and never committed. Native changes go in `app.json` or `mobile/plugins/`.
- TypeScript strict. Prefer `export type` for type-only exports.
- Prettier: double quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas, 2 spaces, 100 columns.
- ESLint:
  - unused vars are errors (prefix with `_`);
  - `no-explicit-any` is a warning;
  - `no-require-imports` is an error at the root (the mobile override turns it off).
- Naming:
  - components are PascalCase;
  - hooks are `useX`;
  - unit tests are co-located as `*.test.ts(x)`;
  - API tests live in `api/test/` as `*.spec.ts` / `*.e2e-spec.ts` (CLAUDE.md still says `*.test.ts`, which is stale);
  - DTOs end in `Dto`/`Body`.
- API DTOs use `class-validator`. Raw SQL through `DatabaseService`, no ORM. Migrations in `api/migrations/`.
- Before committing: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run format:check`.
- CI must pass. Feature work goes by PR to `main`, with no force-push.
- "For sync or offline changes, read `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md`; for API changes, read `api-contract-v1.md` and `data-contract-v1.md`." The bbox param is an API change, and the completion column is an offline storage change.
- Research instruction: no `npm install` and no `slopcheck install` during research. The planner must gate every new package behind a `checkpoint:human-verify` (the 01.7 precedent, T1 of plan 01).

## Standard Stack

### Core (already installed, versions verified in `node_modules` this session)

| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| react / react-native | 19.2.3 / 0.86.3 | `createContext`, `useMemo`, `memo`, `Profiler`, `FlatList` | Built-in. No state library is needed for 5 contexts. |
| expo | 57.0.24 | SDK, `expo export`, `expo-doctor`, prebuild | Pinned by root overrides |
| @react-navigation/native | 7.4.1 (core 7.22.1) | Global `ReactNavigation.RootParamList` typing | Declared in `@react-navigation/core` types (`types.d.ts:103-110`) |
| @react-navigation/native-stack, bottom-tabs | 7.19.2 | Stacks, JS tabs (Android + iOS fallback) | Already used |
| react-native-bottom-tabs + @bottom-tabs/react-navigation | 1.4.0 | Native iOS tab bar (liquid glass) | Already used. Autolinked on both platforms. |
| react-native-maps | **1.27.2** (not 1.20) | `Marker`, `onRegionChangeComplete(region, {isGesture})`, `tracksViewChanges` | Already used |
| react-native-gesture-handler | 2.32.0 | Legacy `Swipeable` in list rows | Already used. Keep the legacy `Swipeable`: `ReanimatedSwipeable` needs `react-native-reanimated`, which is not installed. |
| expo-sqlite | 57.x | Migration 2 (`completion` column) through the existing `PRAGMA user_version` runner (`storage/db.ts:17-20,135-222`) | Already used |
| @testing-library/react-native | 14.0.1 | `renderHook` (async, `/pure` entry) for context and hook tests | Recipe in `render-hook-smoke.test.ts` |
| react-test-renderer | 19.2.3 | Full-tree render harness with a mocked `react-native` (pattern in `AuthGateScreen.test.ts`) | Already used. Deprecated upstream, warning suppressed. |
| eslint-plugin-react | 7.37.5 | `react/jsx-no-literals`: no hard-coded JSX text | Installed. Prototyped this session. |
| typescript | 5.9.3 | The AST scanners (strings, pressables, unused styles) as Jest tests | Installed |

### Supporting (new, one package)

| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| supercluster | 9.1.0 (2026-09-03), 7.9 M downloads/week, ships `index.d.ts` | Marker clustering on the JS side: `getClusters(bbox, zoom)`, `getClusterExpansionZoom` | The map tab. JS only, no native module, so no rebuild. ESM-only: Jest needs a `moduleNameMapper` to `dist/supercluster.js` (UMD). |

### Alternatives Considered

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Typed `fr` catalogue object | `i18n-js` 4.5.3 + `expo-localization` 57.0.2 (the audit's suggestion) | Adds lodash/make-plural/bignumber.js plus a native module (`expo-localization`, which needs a rebuild) for a single language. String keys lose compile-time checking. Revisit when a second language is real. |
| `react/jsx-no-literals` + `no-restricted-syntax` | `eslint-plugin-i18next` 6.1.5, `eslint-plugin-react-native-a11y` 3.5.1 | Both are `[OK]` in slopcheck and support ESLint 8, but they are new devDeps for rules the installed tooling already expresses |
| supercluster | Hand-rolled grid clustering (audit L18 option) | Zero deps and about 40 lines for ≤ 500 points. But there is no expansion-zoom, the grid edges produce split clusters, and every edge case is ours. Acceptable fallback if the owner refuses a new dep. |
| supercluster | `react-native-map-clustering` 4.0.0 | Replaces `MapView` with its own wrapper, pins supercluster ^8, adds `@mapbox/geo-viewport`. More intrusive, less control over memoisation. |
| `FlatList` | `@shopify/flash-list` 2.3.2 | Faster recycling, but a new dependency, and row heights vary (photo or no photo, error line). 500 rows is well within `FlatList`'s range. The audit offered either. |
| Contexts + `useMemo` | React Compiler (`experiments.reactCompiler`, on by default in new SDK 54+ templates, **off** in this `app.json`) | Auto-memoisation does not remove the prop funnel. The ts-jest test pipeline does not run the compiler, so render counts in tests would not reflect production. Candidate for a later phase. |
| ts-jest + mocked `react-native` harness | `jest-expo` 57.0.5 or `@react-native/jest-preset` 0.86.3 | Real `FlatList` virtualisation in tests, but a second Jest transform pipeline (Babel) and a large config change. Not needed to prove the render-count and memo properties. |

**Installation (after the owner checkpoint, one plan, never in parallel with another lockfile change):**
```bash
npm install --workspace mobile supercluster@9.1.0
```

**Version verification:** `npm view supercluster@9.1.0` → published 2026-09-03, deps `kdbush ^4.1.0`, `@types/geojson`. No install scripts (only `prepublishOnly`, `test`, `build`). The tarball contains `dist/supercluster.js`, `dist/supercluster.min.js`, `index.js`, `index.d.ts`.

## Package Legitimacy Audit

`slopcheck scan` was run against a scratch `package.json` (never `slopcheck install`, per the owner instruction).

| Package | Registry | Age | Downloads | Source Repo | slopcheck | Disposition |

```
The `./src/screens/` and `./src/hooks/` thresholds cover subdirectories. **New top-level folders (`state/`, `i18n/`, `navigation/`) fall into the `global` bucket, whose threshold is `statements: 100, lines: 100`** (`mobile/jest.unit.config.js`). Either add explicit entries for them, or test them to 100%.

### Pattern 1: Contexts from one assembler, with stable actions

**What:**
- Keep one hook call site (today `useSurveySync` + siblings in `App.tsx`) that owns every side effect.
- Split its output into a few context values, each built with `useMemo` over the fields it contains.
- Wrap actions with a latest-ref wrapper, so their identity never changes even when the handler closes over `surveys` (e.g. `useSurveySyncNetwork` takes `surveys`, `useSurveySync.ts:302-318`).

**When to use:** every field that screens read today through `surveySync.*`, `surveyList.*` or `surveyForm.*`.
**Example:**
```typescript
// Source: React docs (useMemo, createContext); pattern verified against the current hook shapes
export function useLatestCallback<A extends unknown[], R>(fn: (...args: A) => R) {
  const ref = useRef(fn)
  useLayoutEffect(() => { ref.current = fn })   // mobile test mocks must provide useLayoutEffect or use useEffect
  return useCallback((...args: A) => ref.current(...args), [])
}

const statusValue = useMemo(() => ({ status }), [status])            // StatusContext
const sessionValue = useMemo(
  () => ({ isAuthenticated, sessionRestoring, currentUser, profile, profileUpdating,
           localDataOwnerStatus, foreignWork, foreignOwnerEmail }),
  [isAuthenticated, sessionRestoring, currentUser, profile, profileUpdating,
   localDataOwnerStatus, foreignWork, foreignOwnerEmail],
)
const syncActions = useMemo(() => ({ sync: handleSync, pull: handlePullChanges, report: handleReportSurvey }),
  [handleSync, handlePullChanges, handleReportSurvey])                // each wrapped by useLatestCallback
```
- Keep `accessToken` **out** of any widely consumed context. It changes on refresh, and only effects need it. `AccountScreen` reads it today (`AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx:754`) only to send a Bearer header when it loads the profile picture (`AccountScreen.tsx:262`). Give it a narrow `useAccessToken()` hook that only the avatar component calls, so a token refresh re-renders the avatar alone.
- `operationStatus` (`useSurveySync.ts:52,529`) has no consumer outside the hook. Drop it or keep it private.

### Pattern 2: Reproducible before/after render counts (substitute for the DevTools profile)

**What:** One Jest test, committed *before* the refactor, mounts `mobile/App.tsx` under a mocked `react-native` (the `AuthGateScreen.test.ts` pattern) with:
- mocked navigation libraries whose navigators render **every** screen at once, which simulates "every mounted tab";
- each screen module replaced by a probe that counts renders (`jest.fn` inside `jest.mock("../screens/X")`, or `<Profiler id onRender>` around each probe);
- `useAuth0Session` mocked to an authenticated session. Capture its `reportStatus` argument, which is the status entry point today.

Then:
1. Run `act(() => reportStatus("session","idle","x"))`.
2. Type one character through the form probe's `setSiteName` (today a prop, afterwards from context).
3. Refresh the list with one survey changed.
4. Record the counts per screen and per row as JSON.

The same file runs on the phase branch. The recorded JSON (before from `main`, after from the branch) is attached to VALIDATION.md.

**Expected shape:**
- Before: one status update re-renders all 7 probes and every row. One keystroke does the same.
- After: a status update re-renders `SettingsScreen` only. A keystroke re-renders only the form screens. A one-survey change re-renders one row.

**Why not DevTools:** no device or simulator is available to Claude, and the owner no longer runs phone tests. The criterion's intent, a measurable before/after, is met by committed numbers. That is more reproducible than an attached profile. Say so explicitly in VALIDATION.md (Open Question 5).

**Harness details:**
- The fake navigator must call render-callback children, *and* render `component=` screens, because the after-structure uses `component`.
- Keep `testEnvironment: "node"`.
- Mock `react-native` with string host components plus `StyleSheet.create: (s) => s`, `FlatList` (renders `data.slice(0, initialNumToRender ?? 10).map(renderItem)` so row memo is observable), `Platform`, `Alert`, `Animated` (copy from `AuthGateScreen.test.ts:25-70`).

### Pattern 3: `FlatList` with memoised rows

```typescript
// Source: React Native FlatList docs (keyExtractor, renderItem, windowSize); React.memo
const SurveyRow = memo(function SurveyRow({ survey, preview, selected, onOpen, onDelete }: RowProps) { ... })
// onOpen/onDelete take the id: stable callbacks from context, not closures per row
const renderItem = useCallback(({ item }: ListRenderItemInfo<LocalSurvey>) => (
  <SurveyRow survey={item} preview={previewById[item.id] ?? null}
             selected={item.id === selectedSurveyId} onOpen={openSurvey} onDelete={confirmDelete} />
), [previewById, selectedSurveyId, openSurvey, confirmDelete])
<Animated.FlatList data={mainListSurveys} keyExtractor={(s) => s.id} renderItem={renderItem}
  ListHeaderComponent={header} ListEmptyComponent={empty}
  onScroll={Animated.event([{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { y: scrollY } } }], { useNativeDriver: true })}
  initialNumToRender={10} windowSize={7} removeClippedSubviews />
```
- The collapsing hero (`scrollY`, `SurveyListScreen.tsx:~320`) moves to `ListHeaderComponent`. Keep `Animated.FlatList`, since the hero reads `scrollY`.
- The attention section and the "continue draft" card (`:912-1000`) move into the header component. They are short lists.
- Per-row `Swipeable` refs become local to `SurveyRow` (`useRef`), replacing the `let swipeableRef` closure (`:1031`).
- `previewById` is derived once with `useMemo` from `attachmentsBySurvey`, so each row gets one primitive-ish prop.

### Pattern 4: Completion precomputed at write time (SQLite migration 2)

**What:**
- Add `payload_completion INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to `local_surveys`, and bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` to 2 (`storage/db.ts:20`). Migration 2 backfills with a JS loop over existing rows inside the migration transaction.
- Write the value at the **four payload-write sites only**, using the payload-only part of `computeCompletionRate`:
  - `createLocalDraft` (`storage/surveys.ts:45`);
  - `updateLocalDraft` (`surveys.ts:384`);
  - `applyRemoteChanges` insert (`storage/sync.ts:293`);
  - `applyRemoteChanges` update (`storage/sync.ts:315`).
- Status-only updates (`surveys.ts:510,551,595`, `sync.ts:76,538,758,1246,1262,1282`) never change the payload, so they need no change. The status rule (submitted = 100) is applied in SQL:
```sql
SELECT id, site_name, status, ..., CASE WHEN status = 'submitted' THEN 100 ELSE payload_completion END AS completion_rate
FROM local_surveys ORDER BY updated_at DESC
```
`listLocalSurveys` then no longer selects `payload_json` at all. Fix the `DraftCard` unit bug in the same plan: it must use `completion_rate / 100` and `Math.round(completion_rate / 10)`.

### Pattern 5: Screen split = container + presentational parts

- The container reads contexts and navigation, and owns callbacks.
- The view is pure props.
- Sub-components are sections: header, filters, row, action bar, tabs (summary/events/debug), marker layers.
- Styles live next to each part.
- The 400-line rule applies to every file under `mobile/src/screens/`, `.styles.ts` included. The check is a Jest test that walks the directory. The same test covers `navigation/` (`AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx` is 961 lines today). Unused keys are then checked by the committed scanner (Pattern 9).

### Pattern 6: Typed navigation (React Navigation 7)

```typescript
// Source: @react-navigation/core 7.22 types.d.ts:103-110 (global ReactNavigation.RootParamList)
declare global {
  namespace ReactNavigation {
    interface RootParamList extends RootTabParamList {}
  }
}
// then, with no cast:
const navigation = useNavigation()
navigation.navigate("surveys", { screen: "surveyForm" })   // checked against NavigatorScreenParams
// inside a stack screen:
type Props = CompositeScreenProps<NativeStackScreenProps<SurveysStackParamList, "surveyDetail">,
                                  BottomTabScreenProps<RootTabParamList>>
```
- The global declaration works for both tab implementations. The native one (`@bottom-tabs/react-navigation`) is not a `BottomTabNavigationProp`, so it is safer than a cast.
- Pass `surveyId` in the route params (`surveyDetail: { surveyId: string }`) instead of the out-of-band `selectedSurveyId` if the split makes that natural. This is optional.

### Pattern 7: Map by bbox, clustered, memoised, debounced

**API (additive):**
- Add `@IsOptional() @IsString() @MaxLength(128) bbox?: string` to `PublicMapItemsQueryDto`.
- `PublicMapService.getPublicMapItems` parses it with the existing `parseBbox` (`surveys-normalize.utils.ts:342-365`, which rejects malformed input with 400).
- `buildPublicMapItemsQuery` appends a predicate that keeps "limit first":
```sql
AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM survey_parcels sp JOIN parcels p ON p.parcel_id = sp.parcel_id
            WHERE sp.survey_id = s.id
              AND p.centroid_lat BETWEEN $n AND $n+1 AND p.centroid_lng BETWEEN $n+2 AND $n+3)
```
- Old clients without `bbox` get today's answer.
- Prove the plan with an EXPLAIN in the style of `public-routes-explain.e2e-spec.ts`, plus a new `public-map-bbox.e2e-spec.ts`.
- Update the `api-contract-v1.md:931-947` entry.

**Mobile:**
1. `usePublicMapExplorer.loadPublicMap` gains a `bbox`.
2. The map container keeps `region` in state, set by a **debounced** (400 ms) `onRegionChangeComplete`.
3. It derives `bbox = computeRegionBbox(region)` (`app/map-viewport.ts`), with a request-key dedupe and the `requestRef` stale guard already used for parcels (`usePublicMapExplorer.ts:43-76`).
4. Clusters:
```typescript
const index = useMemo(() => { const sc = new Supercluster({ radius: 60, maxZoom: 16 });
  sc.load(items.map(toPointFeature)); return sc }, [items])
const clusters = useMemo(() => index.getClusters(bboxArray(region), computeRegionZoom(region)), [index, region])
// memo(ClusterMarker) with tracksViewChanges={false}; memo(SurveyMarker) with onPress(id) stable
```
Remove the auto-fit effect (`PublicMapScreen.tsx:130-133`), or run it only on an explicit filter change (Pitfall 6).

### Pattern 8: Typed French catalogue and status codes

```typescript
// mobile/src/i18n/fr.ts
export const fr = {
  tabs: { home: "Accueil", surveys: "Mes relevés", search: "Recherche", map: "Explorer", account: "Compte" },
  status: {
    syncDone: (p: { synced: number; failed: number }) =>
      `Synchronisation terminée : ${p.synced} envoyé${p.synced > 1 ? "s" : ""}, ${p.failed} en échec`,
    submitNeedsSync: () => "Synchronisez le relevé avant de le soumettre.",
    networkError: () => "Réseau indisponible. Réessayez plus tard.",
  },
  a11y: { deleteSurvey: (name: string) => `Supprimer le relevé ${name}` },
} as const
export type Catalog = Widen<typeof fr>   // Widen maps string literals to string, so an `en: Catalog` can exist later
```
- `setStatus(message: string)` becomes `reportStatus({ code, params?, detail? })`:
  - `code` is a key of `fr.status`;
  - `params` carry counts and names, **never ids**;
  - `detail` (the raw error text) goes to `console.debug` under `__DEV__` and to the dev-tools panel only (`shouldShowDevTools()`).
- The per-survey sync error uses `last_sync_error_code` (already stored) through a code → message map, instead of the regex over free text (`app/formatters.ts:33-53`).
- Gate the Debug tab of the survey detail behind `shouldShowDevTools()`. Map event types (`event.event_type`, `SurveyDetailScreen.tsx:1236`) to French labels. Stop printing `formatEventPayload` JSON outside dev tools.
- Translate `app.json` permission strings (iOS `NS*UsageDescription` through the plugin options). This changes Info.plist at the next prebuild, with no native code change.

### Pattern 9: Gates that need no new dependency (prototyped this session)

- **No hard-coded JSX text:** `react/jsx-no-literals` from `eslint-plugin-react` 7.37.5, scoped by an `overrides` entry to `src/screens/**`, `src/ui/**`, `src/components/**`, `src/navigation/**`. Use `{ "noStrings": true, "ignoreProps": true }`. Text props are covered by the next rule, because `noAttributeStrings` would also flag `accessibilityRole="button"`.
- **Text props, `Alert.alert` literals, a11y** through `no-restricted-syntax` (esquery 1.7.0 supports `:has`):
```json
{ "selector": "JSXAttribute[name.name=/^(title|label|placeholder|accessibilityLabel|accessibilityHint|subtitle|message)$/] > Literal", "message": "Use the i18n catalogue" },
{ "selector": "CallExpression[callee.object.name='Alert'][callee.property.name='alert'] > :matches(Literal, TemplateLiteral)", "message": "Use the i18n catalogue" },
{ "selector": "JSXOpeningElement[name.name='Pressable']:not(:has(JSXAttribute[name.name='accessibilityRole']))", "message": "Pressable needs accessibilityRole" },
{ "selector": "JSXOpeningElement[name.name='Pressable']:not(:has(JSXAttribute[name.name='accessibilityLabel']))", "message": "Pressable needs accessibilityLabel" }
```
- **Scanners as Jest tests**, using the TypeScript AST like the scripts written for this research. They cover what lint cannot:
  1. unused `StyleSheet.create` keys = 0, excluding intentional dynamic `styles[variant]` in `src/ui/*`;
  2. every file under `screens/` and `navigation/` ≤ 400 lines;
  3. no status/alert literal outside `i18n/`.

  Start them as ratchets with an allowlist during the waves, and end at zero.

### Pattern 10: Hygiene with an autolinking diff

Before and after the root and dependency changes, run from `mobile/`:
```bash
npx expo-modules-autolinking resolve -p android --json      # Expo modules (works on Linux, verified)
npx expo-modules-autolinking react-native-config -p android --json   # community modules (verified)
npm ls react react-native expo --all                          # one copy each
```
- Today the community list is `expo react-native-auth0 react-native-bottom-tabs react-native-gesture-handler react-native-maps react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens react-native-svg`.
- It must be identical after the change, except for a deliberate tab-library removal. Add the 01.3 source-map single-copy check after `expo export`.
- Changes:
  - Delete the root `App.tsx` and its `.dockerignore` line.
  - Delete the root `dependencies` block, keeping `overrides` and `devDependencies.react-test-renderer`.
  - Delete the root `tsconfig.json`, since nothing extends it (checked: `api/` and `mobile/` extend their own).
  - Update the stale Dockerfile comment ("root package.json's dependencies are Expo/React Native").
  - Move `@expo/ngrok` to mobile `devDependencies`. `expo start --tunnel` still finds it in dev installs.

### Pattern 11: Native builds in CI instead of on a phone

The repository is public, so GitHub-hosted runners, macOS included, are free.
- **Android (ubuntu-latest):**
  1. `actions/setup-java` 17;
  2. `npx expo prebuild -p android --no-install`;
  3. `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease`. The Expo template signs release with the debug keystore.

  Expect about 20-30 min.
- **iOS (macos-latest):**
  1. `npx expo prebuild -p ios`;
  2. `pod install`;
  3. `xcodebuild -workspace ios/Cortege.xcworkspace -scheme Cortege -configuration Release -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build`.

  Expect about 30-45 min.
- Optional: `xcrun simctl boot` + `install` + `launch --console-pty` and fail on `RCTFatal`. The NavigationContainer and the tab navigator mount **beneath** the auth overlay (`App.tsx:196-197`), so a boot smoke test does exercise native tab creation. That catches #119's class of module-init crash.
- Trigger: a `native` path filter (`mobile/package.json`, `mobile/app.json`, `mobile/plugins/**`, `package-lock.json`) plus `workflow_dispatch`.
- Not proven by CI: tab taps after login, and the liquid-glass rendering. That is the one owner step (Open Question 4).

### Pattern 12: Docs sweep and audit status table

- CLAUDE.md facts to correct:
  - RN 0.86.3, Expo 57.0.24, react-native-maps 1.27.2, Node ≥ 22.5;
  - `POST /v1/sync` and `GET /v1/sync/changes`;
  - `local_meta`, and the SQLite `PRAGMA user_version` migrations;
  - API tests `api/test/*.spec.ts` + `*.e2e-spec.ts`; mobile `*.sqlite.test.ts` on `node:sqlite`;
  - the real CI jobs: `changes`, `check` (lint, format, typecheck, actionlint), `unit-api`, `unit-mobile`, `e2e`, `e2e-minio`, `mobile-build` (expo-doctor, expo export), `audit`, `image-check`, plus `codeql.yml`;
  - the hooks list (add `useLocalDataOwner`, `useAttachmentPreviews`, `useNearbyParcels`, `useParcelStatuses`), and "no Context API" becomes the contexts;
  - the API module table (`config/`, `surveys-sync`, `survey-events`, `surveys.repository`, `parcels`, `public-map`);
  - the env var table (TRUST_PROXY, CADASTRE_*, DEBUG_DATA_RESET_ENABLED, EMAIL_CHANGE_CONFIRM_URL_TEMPLATE, SMTP_* if kept);
  - `ibp-domain` after 01.8.
- The audit Statut table can be generated:
  1. For each `Merge pull request #N` on `main`, collect the `(01.x-` phase ids of the commits it brings (`git log --format=%s M^1..M^2`). Verified this session: #127–#130 are 01.2, #131–#142 are 01.3, #143–#147 are 01.4, #148–#152 are 01.5, #153–#155 are 01.6, #156–#157 are 01.7.
  2. Join with the ROADMAP "Source" lines (lot → phase) and the audit §6 matrix (finding → lot).

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **One big context holding everything.** It recreates today's funnel. Keep status and form keystrokes in their own contexts.
- **`useMemo` around the context value while the actions inside change identity every render.** The memo never hits. Wrap the actions (Pattern 1).
- **Two calls of the assembler hook**, for example one per provider. That creates two `syncActivity` trackers and two network listeners, and breaks the WR-08 single-flight guarantee.
- **Keeping `Screen` render callbacks after adding contexts.** Use `component={Container}`, or wrap the rendered element in `memo`.
- **Clustering inside `render` without `useMemo`, or rebuilding the supercluster index on every region change.** Rebuild only when `items` changes.
- **Translating by string key lookup (`t("survey.list.title")`).** It loses type checking. Use property access on the typed object.

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Point clustering with zoom expansion | Grid bucketing, custom k-d tree | `supercluster` 9.1.0 | Handles cluster ids, expansion zoom and bbox queries across the antimeridian, and is tested at scale |
| List virtualisation | Manual windowing in a `ScrollView` | `FlatList` (RN core) | Windowing, recycling of offscreen rows, `removeClippedSubviews` |
| Debounce | Ad-hoc timers in several places | One `useDebouncedValue` hook (the existing 400 ms parcel pattern in `PublicMapScreen.tsx:139-155`, extracted) | A single tested implementation. Timers are cleaned up on unmount. |
| Schema migration | Ad-hoc `ALTER TABLE` with swallowed errors | The existing `MIGRATIONS` runner and `PRAGMA user_version` (`db.ts:135-222`) | Atomic version bump, crash-safe re-run (T-01.5-08) |
| Lint rules for literals and a11y | New ESLint plugins or a custom plugin package | `react/jsx-no-literals` + `no-restricted-syntax` (installed) | Zero new deps, prototyped |
| Navigation typing | `as any` or per-call generics | The global `ReactNavigation.RootParamList` | Type-safe everywhere `useNavigation` is called |

**Key insight:** almost everything in this phase is solvable with what is installed. The one new runtime dependency (supercluster) is pure JS, so no native rebuild is needed for criterion 3.

## Runtime State Inventory

The phase moves files and deletes dependencies. The completion column is a data migration.

| Stored data | Installed apps have `local_surveys` rows without a completion column, and `PRAGMA user_version = 1` (01.5). | **Data migration:** migration 2 adds `payload_completion` and backfills it from `payload_json` inside the migration transaction. A code edit writes it at the four payload-write sites. |
| Live service config | The API `/v1/public/map-items` on the VPS gains an optional `bbox`. Deploy is pull-based and automatic on `main` pushes touching `api/**`. No env var is added. | None beyond the normal deploy. The production probe in the owner-check simulation adds a bbox request (read-only). |
| OS-registered state | None. Checked: the phase adds no systemd, launchd or task-scheduler entries. The VPS timer is unchanged. | None |
| Secrets and env vars | `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS` may be `false` in the owner's untracked `mobile/.env` (inferred from #119 and the todo). If `EmailService` goes: `SMTP_*` in `api/src/config/env.schema.ts:66-72`, `app-config.ts:121-128`, `api/.env*.example`, `infra/.env.example`, the CI `SMTP_ENABLED` env, `api/test/env.schema.spec.ts:134-145`, and possibly `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env` on the VPS. | Owner: one `grep` on `mobile/.env`. Code edit for SMTP removal. Unknown `SMTP_*` keys in the VPS env file must stay harmless: check whether the 01.7 config validation rejects unknown keys. It is class-validator with optional fields, and `check-env.sh` should be verified. |

Verify single copies with `npm ls`. |

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: React hook spies break when the assembler adds `useMemo`
**What goes wrong:** `useSurveySync.test.ts`, `useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts` and 8 other hook tests call hooks **outside a renderer**, with `jest.spyOn(React, "useState"|"useCallback"|"useEffect")` (counted this session). A new `useMemo`/`useContext`/`useLayoutEffect` in those hooks hits the real dispatcher and throws.
**How to avoid:** Rewrite `useSurveySync.test.ts` on the `renderHook` recipe, as `useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` already does. This is what REQ-AUD-test-infra (01.3) intended. Only touch the other spy-based tests if their hooks change.
**Warning signs:** "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useMemo')" in unit tests.

### Pitfall 2: New top-level folders hit the 100 % global coverage threshold
**What goes wrong:** Files outside the listed directories count against `global: { statements: 100, lines: 100 }` (`mobile/jest.unit.config.js`). A new `src/state/` or `src/i18n/` fails CI at 99 %.
**How to avoid:** Add threshold entries for the new directories at their measured values (the ratchet rule: never lower). The `hooks/` threshold is 85 % statements, so logic moved from screens into hooks needs tests.

### Pitfall 3: Context values that are memoised but still change
**What goes wrong:** Handlers from sub-hooks depend on `surveys` or `accessToken`, so their identity changes and the memoised value changes too. The render counts do not drop.
**How to avoid:** Use `useLatestCallback` for every action. The harness (Pattern 2) proves it. Assert that a status update re-renders 0 list rows.

### Pitfall 4: Breaking the single-flight and owner gate while moving code
**What goes wrong:** Splitting `useSurveySync` into several providers that each call a sub-hook duplicates `syncActivity` or the network listeners.
**How to avoid:** One assembler call at the root. Providers only receive values. Keep `sync-owner-gate.test.ts` and `useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` green unchanged.

### Pitfall 5: `FlatList` with the collapsing hero
**What goes wrong:** Moving `Animated.ScrollView` to a plain `FlatList` loses `scrollY`. `ListHeaderComponent` as an inline element re-mounts on each render.
**How to avoid:** Use `Animated.FlatList`, and pass a memoised header element. Keep `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` and the refresh control props.

### Pitfall 6: Bbox loading plus auto-fit is a feedback loop
**What goes wrong:** `useEffect(() => animateToRegion(computeRegionFromItems(items)), [targetRegion])` (`PublicMapScreen.tsx:130-133`) moves the camera after each load. That triggers `onRegionChangeComplete` → a new bbox → a new load.
**How to avoid:** Fit only on the first load or on a filter change. Use `details.isGesture` (react-native-maps 1.27 `Details`) to distinguish user moves from programmatic ones.

### Pitfall 7: Clusters that never split
**What goes wrong:** `display_location` is rounded to 2 decimals (~1 km) by the API (`public-map.utils.ts:44-47`, a privacy rule in `api-contract-v1.md:946`). Several surveys share exact coordinates, so they stay clustered even at max zoom.
**How to avoid:** At `maxZoom` a cluster tap opens a list of its surveys (`getLeaves`) instead of zooming.

### Pitfall 8: supercluster is ESM-only
**What goes wrong:** `exports: "./index.js"` with `"type": "module"` fails under ts-jest CommonJS (the same class as the 01.7 `@nestjs/config` issue).
**How to avoid:** Add `moduleNameMapper: { '^supercluster$': '<rootDir>/../node_modules/supercluster/dist/supercluster.js' }` (UMD, shipped in the tarball). Metro resolves the ESM fine.

### Pitfall 9: The literal rule flags roles and style strings
**What goes wrong:** `jsx-no-literals` with `noAttributeStrings` flags `accessibilityRole="button"`, `contentFit="cover"` and similar.
**How to avoid:** Use `ignoreProps: true`, plus the named-prop `no-restricted-syntax` selector (Pattern 9).

### Pitfall 10: Status text that is also used as logic
**What goes wrong:** Some code may compare status strings, or tests may assert English messages (e.g. `useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts` has many message assertions).
**How to avoid:** Status codes are typed unions. Update the test assertions to codes. Grep for `status ===`/`toContain("` on messages.

### Pitfall 11: Accessibility labels that leak ids or become stale
**What goes wrong:** Labels built from `survey.id`, or labels that repeat visible text and double-announce.
**How to avoid:** Labels come from the catalogue with a human name (`site_name`). Add `accessibilityState` for selected, disabled and busy (the list row already does, `SurveyListScreen.tsx:1062-1064`).

### Pitfall 12: The "unused tab library" does not exist
**What goes wrong:** Removing `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` breaks Android, which always uses JS tabs (`AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx:127`). Removing `react-native-bottom-tabs` loses the iOS native bar and needs a native rebuild plus a device look.
**How to avoid:** Owner decision (Open Question 1). The recommendation is to keep both, record the evidence in VERIFICATION, and remove the dead fallback paths only. The Expo Go check (`Constants.appOwnership !== "expo"`) is dead code: Expo Go cannot run `react-native-auth0` anyway. That is an inference, not verified on a device.

### Pitfall 13: Root dependency removal changes hoisting
**What goes wrong:** Without the root pins, npm could nest a second `react` under `mobile/node_modules` if any range disagrees. That produces two React copies and a crash at runtime.
**How to avoid:** Keep the root `overrides` (they pin versions). Check with `npm ls react react-native expo --all`, the autolinking diff, and the source-map single-copy check after `expo export` (01.3 method).

### Pitfall 14: Lockfile conflicts with 01.8
**What goes wrong:** 01.8 adds a workspace and its dependency edges, while this phase removes dependencies. Parallel branches both rewrite `package-lock.json`.
**How to avoid:** At most one lockfile-changing plan in flight. Resolve conflicts by regenerating (`npm install`) and re-running the autolinking diff, never by hand-merging the lockfile.

### Pitfall 15: Removing `EmailService` but leaving `SMTP_*` validation
**What goes wrong:** Deleting the service leaves config fields no code reads. Deleting the fields makes a production env file that still sets them fail, if the validator forbids unknown keys.
**How to avoid:** Check `env.schema.ts` whitelist behaviour and `infra/vps/check-env.sh` before deleting. Update `check-env-parity.spec.ts` and the env examples together.

## Code Examples

### Render-count probe (harness core)
```typescript
// Source: React Profiler API (onRender id, phase), jest.mock factories; mobile test conventions
const renders: Record<string, number> = {}
function probe(name: string) {
  return function Probe(_props: unknown) { renders[name] = (renders[name] ?? 0) + 1; return null }
}
jest.mock("../screens/SettingsScreen", () => ({ SettingsScreen: probe("settings") }))
// ... one per screen; fake navigators render every Screen's children/component
await act(async () => { capturedReportStatus!("session", "idle", "x") })
expect(renders).toMatchSnapshot()   // or write JSON to a file for VALIDATION.md
```

### Migration 2
```typescript
// Source: mobile/src/storage/db.ts MIGRATIONS pattern (T-01.5-08)
async function migration2(tx: TxHandle): Promise<void> {
  await ensureColumn(tx, "local_surveys", "payload_completion", "payload_completion INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0")
  const rows = await tx.getAllAsync<{ id: string; payload_json: string | null }>(
    `SELECT id, payload_json FROM local_surveys`)
  for (const row of rows) {
    const payload = row.payload_json ? toSurveyQueuePayload(safeParseJson(row.payload_json)) : null
    await tx.runAsync(`UPDATE local_surveys SET payload_completion = ? WHERE id = ?`,
      [computePayloadCompletion(payload), row.id])
  }
}
```

### Debounced region
```typescript
function useDebouncedValue<T>(value: T, ms: number): T {
  const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value)
  useEffect(() => { const t = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(value), ms); return () => clearTimeout(t) }, [value, ms])
  return debounced
}
```

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Screens as `Screen` render callbacks | `component=` or a memoised element | React Navigation 5+ (documented) | Render callbacks bypass navigator optimisations |
| Manual `useMemo`/`memo` everywhere | React Compiler (Expo SDK 54+ templates enable `experiments.reactCompiler`) | 2025 (Compiler v1.0) | Not enabled here. Adopting it later is compatible with contexts. Tests would not reflect it (ts-jest). |
| `useNavigation<any>()` | Global `ReactNavigation.RootParamList` (v7), or a static `RootNavigator` interface (7.x core also declares it) | RN7 | Type-safe calls without generics |
| i18n libraries for single-language apps | Typed `as const` catalogues | — | No runtime lookup, compile-time key checks |

**Deprecated or outdated:**
- `react-test-renderer`: deprecated upstream, still used here. It is fine for the harness. Migrating to `test-renderer`/RNTL `render` is not in scope.
- Audit numbers are stale: 63 keys (now 50), 158 unused styles (now 301), `SurveyListScreen:992` (now `:1019`), RN 0.86.3 / Expo 57 in the audit table (correct), react-native-maps "1.20" in the roadmap (now 1.27.2).

## Assumptions Log

| # | Claim | Section | Risk if Wrong |
|---|-------|---------|---------------|
| A1 | The owner's `mobile/.env` contains `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false`, which explains the JS tab bar in Release | User Constraints, Pitfall 12 | The Release issue has another cause, and a device investigation is needed |
| A2 | GitHub `macos-latest` has an Xcode that builds Expo 57 / RN 0.86 (the README mentions an Xcode 27 floor) [ASSUMED] | Pattern 11 | The iOS CI job needs a pinned `macos-26`/Xcode selection, or an EAS build (owner Expo token) |
| A3 | The Expo template's Android release variant signs with the debug keystore, so `assembleRelease` works without secrets [ASSUMED] | Pattern 11 | Use `assembleDebug` for the compile check, or add a throwaway keystore |
| A4 | Expo Go cannot run this app (react-native-auth0), so the Expo Go fallback is dead [ASSUMED] | Pitfall 12 | Low. The fallback would stay reachable with the env flag anyway. |
| A5 | The harness with fake navigators is representative of "every mounted tab" re-renders [ASSUMED design] | Pattern 2 | Counts could differ from a device profile. The criterion's evidence is weaker. |
| A6 | The class-validator env schema tolerates leftover `SMTP_*` keys in the VPS env file [ASSUMED] | Runtime State, Pitfall 15 | The production start refuses. Must be checked before deleting. |
| A7 | 500 surveys stay "fluid" once rows are memoised and virtualised. Only proxies are measurable without a device. [ASSUMED] | Pattern 3 | A device regression would be found only in the field tests (Phase 7) |

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

Phrased for the owner, in French. All five were answered on 2026-09-26 and are locked in 10-CONTEXT.md:

- Q1 (tab libraries) → **RESOLVED by D-08**: keep both libraries; native iOS bar always in Release; the Recherche tab is removed.
- Q2 (EmailService / SMTP) → **RESOLVED by D-09**: remove EmailService, nodemailer and the `SMTP_*` settings (plus `EMAIL_CHANGE_CONFIRM_URL_TEMPLATE`, pattern map C-2).
- Q3 (supercluster) → **RESOLVED by D-05**: `supercluster@9.1.0` approved; `npm view` gate at install.
- Q4 (native builds without a phone) → **RESOLVED by D-10 and D-11**: iOS and Android builds in GitHub Actions; one short owner device check at the end of the phase.
- Q5 (DevTools profile) → **RESOLVED by D-02**: a committed Jest render-count test replaces the before/after profile.

Original questions, kept for the record:

1. **Onglets : laquelle des deux bibliothèques retirer ?**
   - Ce qu'on sait : aucune n'est inutilisée. `react-native-bottom-tabs` dessine la barre native sur iPhone. `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` dessine la barre sur Android, et sert de secours sur iPhone.
   - Recommandation : garder les deux, et ne supprimer que le code de secours mort (Expo Go). Le critère 5 est alors rempli en prouvant qu'aucune n'est inutile.
   - Autre choix : tout passer en natif. L'apparence d'Android change, et il faut un contrôle visuel sur un téléphone Android.
2. **`EmailService` et l'envoi d'e-mails (SMTP) : on supprime ?**
   - Ce code n'est branché nulle part.
   - Recommandation : supprimer le service, `nodemailer` et les variables `SMTP_*`. Si un envoi d'e-mails est prévu bientôt, on le garde et on le branche plus tard.
3. **Nouvelle dépendance `supercluster` pour regrouper les points sur la carte : d'accord ?**
   - Bibliothèque JavaScript de Mapbox, très utilisée, sans code natif, donc sans nouveau build natif.
   - Sinon : un regroupement maison par grille, plus simple mais moins précis.
4. **Vérification native sans téléphone : d'accord pour des builds iOS et Android dans GitHub Actions ?**
   - Ces builds sont gratuits, car le dépôt est public.
   - Il resterait une seule étape pour vous : sur votre Mac, lancer `grep NATIVE_TABS mobile/.env`, retirer la ligne si elle vaut `false`, puis ouvrir une build Release sur l'iPhone et toucher chaque onglet. Ce contrôle se fait après connexion, ce que la CI ne peut pas faire. Il permettrait aussi de refaire le test de démarrage hors ligne resté en attente depuis la phase 01.5.
   - Préférez-vous le faire dans cette phase, ou avec la prochaine version corrective ?
5. **Preuve des re-rendus : un rapport de tests automatiques à la place d'un profil React DevTools ?**
   - Le critère 1 demande un profil React DevTools « avant/après ». Sans téléphone, on propose un rapport de comptage de rendus, produit par un test automatique et joint à la phase.
   - Il est reproductible par n'importe qui. Acceptez-vous ce remplacement ?

## Validation Architecture

### Test Framework
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework | Jest 29 + ts-jest (`testEnvironment: node`), `@testing-library/react-native` 14 (`/pure`), `react-test-renderer` 19.2.3, `node:sqlite`-backed expo-sqlite mock |
| Config file | `mobile/jest.unit.config.js`, `api/jest.unit.config.js`, `api/jest.config.js` (E2E) |
| Quick run command | `cd mobile && npx jest --runInBand --config jest.unit.config.js <paths>` (about 4 s for 2 suites, measured) |
| Full suite command | `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test:unit && npm run format:check && npm run test:e2e` |

### Phase Requirements → Test Map
| Req ID | Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists? |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | A status update re-renders only Settings. A keystroke only the form. A single-survey change one row. | render harness | `npx jest src/state/render-counts.test.tsx` | ❌ Wave 0 (baseline recorded on current code) |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | Context values are stable across unrelated updates. Actions keep identity. | unit (renderHook) | `npx jest src/state/*.test.ts*` | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | `useSurveySync` rewritten on renderHook. Owner gate and purge unchanged. | unit | `npx jest src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts src/hooks/sync-owner-gate.test.ts src/hooks/useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` | ✅ (rewrite 1) |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | Migration 2 backfills. `listLocalSurveys` never reads `payload_json`. 500 rows. Submitted = 100. | SQLite | `npx jest src/storage/db.migration.sqlite.test.ts src/storage/surveys.completion.sqlite.test.ts` | partial (❌ new file) |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | `DraftCard` progress uses 0-100 | unit | `npx jest src/components/cards/DraftCard.test.tsx` | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | List rows are `memo`. `renderItem` is stable. Only the first `initialNumToRender` rows mount. | render harness | same harness file | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | No file in `screens/`, `navigation/` > 400 lines. 0 unused style keys. | scanner test | `npx jest src/__checks__/structure.test.ts` | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | No `as any` in navigation (typecheck + grep) | typecheck + lint | `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` | ✅ |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | Map: debounced region, bbox in request, stale response ignored, clusters from supercluster, index built once per items | unit | `npx jest src/hooks/usePublicMapExplorer.test.ts src/screens/public-map/*.test.ts` | partial |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-state | API bbox: filter correct, 400 on a malformed bbox, old callers unchanged, no seq scan | E2E + EXPLAIN | `npm run test:e2e -- public-map-bbox` | ❌ new file (not the idempotency file) |
| REQ-AUD-i18n-a11y | No JSX literal, no literal text prop or `Alert` literal outside `i18n/` | lint | `npm run lint` | ❌ config |
| REQ-AUD-i18n-a11y | Every status code has a French message. No message contains an id pattern (UUID, `survey-\d+`). | unit | `npx jest src/i18n/*.test.ts` | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-i18n-a11y | Every `Pressable` in the three screens (after the split: their folders) has a role and a label | lint + scanner | `npm run lint` | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-i18n-a11y | The Debug tab is hidden when `shouldShowDevTools()` is false | unit | `npx jest src/screens/survey-detail/*.test.tsx` | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-hygiene | Autolinking lists identical, `npm ls` single copies, `expo export` + single-copy source map | CI + script | `mobile-build` job + a new step | partial |
| REQ-AUD-hygiene | Native builds pass | CI | new `native-android` / `native-ios` jobs | ❌ |
| REQ-AUD-hygiene | Image builds, no mobile deps in the image, API boots | CI | `image-check` | ✅ |
| REQ-AUD-hygiene | Docs facts (versions, routes, table names) match the code | scripted grep check in VERIFICATION | `node scripts/...` or manual review | ❌ (deferred to after 01.8) |

### Sampling Rate
- **Per task commit:** the quick run on the touched suites, plus `npm run lint` for i18n/a11y tasks.
- **Per wave merge:** the full mobile unit suite and typecheck. Add the API unit + E2E for the bbox wave.
- **Phase gate:** full suite green; CI green including the native jobs; the render-count JSON before/after recorded in VALIDATION.md; owner-check simulation `production` extended with a bbox probe.

### Wave 0 Gaps
- [ ] `mobile/src/state/render-counts.test.tsx`: the harness, run first on the current code to record the baseline JSON.
- [ ] `mobile/src/__checks__/structure.test.ts`: line count ≤ 400, unused style keys, literal/status scanner (start as ratchets with allowlists).
- [ ] ESLint overrides in `mobile/.eslintrc.json`: `jsx-no-literals`, `no-restricted-syntax` selectors, as `warn` first, then `error` per migrated folder.
- [ ] `coverageThreshold` entries for `./src/state/`, `./src/i18n/`, `./src/navigation/`.
- [ ] CI jobs `native-android` and `native-ios`, run once on the unchanged tree to establish green before any hygiene change.
- [ ] Autolinking baseline JSON saved in the phase directory.

## Security Domain

### Applicable ASVS Categories

| ASVS Category | Applies | Standard Control |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| V2 Authentication | no | Unchanged (Auth0). Contexts must not expose `accessToken` to screens that do not need it. |
| V3 Session Management | no | Unchanged |
| V4 Access Control | yes (minor) | `/public/map-items` stays unauthenticated with the public predicate. bbox only narrows it. |
| V5 Input Validation | yes | `class-validator` `@MaxLength` on `bbox` plus the existing `parseBbox` (400 on malformed input) |
| V6 Cryptography | no | — |
| V7 Error handling and logging | yes | No ids or technical text in user-facing messages. Raw detail only under `__DEV__`/dev tools. The Debug tab is gated. |
| V14 Configuration / dependencies | yes | Remove unused deps (smaller surface). One new JS dep behind an owner checkpoint. `npm audit --audit-level=high` in CI. |

### Known Threat Patterns for this stack

| Pattern | STRIDE | Standard Mitigation |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Oversized or malformed bbox on a public route | DoS / Tampering | Validation + `LIMIT 500` kept + index-backed predicate (EXPLAIN in the PR) |
| Internal ids and error text shown to users (and in screenshots) | Information disclosure | Status codes → catalogue. Debug tab and event JSON behind `shouldShowDevTools()`. |
| Supply-chain risk of a new package | Tampering | slopcheck `[OK]`, no install scripts, owner checkpoint, pinned version |
| Leftover secrets config after removing `EmailService` | Information disclosure | Remove `SMTP_*` from the examples and the schema together, and verify the VPS env |

### Primary (HIGH confidence)
- Repository code, read at file:line in this session: `mobile/App.tsx`, `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts`, `useSurveyList.ts`, `usePublicMapExplorer.ts`, `mobile/src/app/AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx`, `useAppBottomTabBarHeight.ts`, `mobile/src/screens/*`, `mobile/src/storage/{db,surveys,sync,utils}.ts`, `mobile/src/components/cards/DraftCard.tsx`, `api/src/surveys/{public.controller,public-map.service,public-map.queries,public-map.utils}.ts`, `dtos/public-map-items-query.dto.ts`, `api/migrations/015_*.sql`, `api/Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, root/mobile/api `package.json`, `mobile/jest.unit.config.js`, `mobile/.eslintrc.json`, `mobile/app.json`, `mobile/README-native.md`
- Measurements run this session (scratch scripts using the TypeScript compiler API): unused style keys (956 keys, 326 flagged, 301 real after excluding dynamic `styles[variant]`), 552 user-facing literals, Pressable accessibility per file, hook return key counts, React spy usage in tests
- `@react-navigation/core` 7.22.1 `types.d.ts:85-110` (global `RootParamList`, `RootNavigator`); `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` 7.19.2 package exports (`./unstable` native tabs); `react-native-maps` 1.27.2 `dist/src/MapMarker.d.ts:247-255` (`tracksViewChanges`), `MapView.types.d.ts` (`Details.isGesture`)
- npm registry: `npm view` for supercluster, i18n-js, expo-localization, react-native-map-clustering, eslint plugins, jest-expo, @react-native/jest-preset, react-native-maps, both tab libraries; npm downloads API; `npm pack --dry-run` file list for supercluster 9.1.0
- slopcheck scan (all candidates `[OK]`)
- Git history: `fb22c7b` (#119 native tabs after SDK 57), merge commits #127–#157 mapped to phases
- GitHub API: `florianlepont/cortege` is public
- ESLint prototype: `react/jsx-no-literals` and `no-restricted-syntax` with `:has()` (esquery 1.7.0) run through `Linter` in this session

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)
- React Navigation docs, Screen: render callbacks remove optimisations (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/screen/)
- React Navigation docs, TypeScript: root navigator declaration; annotating `useNavigation` is not type-safe (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/typescript/). The page served is the current major. The v7 global form is confirmed in the installed types.
- Expo React Compiler guide and SDK 57 template defaults (https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/, https://github.com/mattwwarren/mobile-template/issues/10)

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- The cause of the iOS Release tab issue (A1): inferred from the #119 commit message and the STATE todo. Not observable here.

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH. The versions were read from `node_modules` and the registry, and the one new package was checked.
- Architecture: HIGH for the contexts, FlatList and migration designs, which are grounded in current code. MEDIUM for the harness and the CI native jobs, which are designed but not run.
- Pitfalls: HIGH. Most were reproduced or read directly: hook spies, coverage buckets, the auto-fit loop, the ESM mapping, the tab usage.
- 01.8 split: HIGH. It follows from the 01.8 criteria and the file overlap.

**Research date:** 2026-09-26
**Valid until:** 2026-10-26 (the Expo/RN versions are pinned; revisit if 01.8 lands with a different package layout)
