# Phase 01.9 Plan 09: Five memoised contexts and the single assembler Summary

The app state now lives in five memoised contexts, filled by one assembler (`AppStateProvider`) that calls `useSurveySync` once. `useSurveySync` returns memoised slices whose actions keep their identity. `App.tsx` is now a thin shell, and `AuthenticatedAppNavigation` takes no props.

## What was built

**`mobile/src/state/useLatestCallback.ts`**
- `useLatestCallback(fn)` returns a function created once. It calls a ref that is updated in `useLayoutEffect` (W1).
- `useStableActions(actions)` returns an object created once, with the keys of the first render. Each member forwards to `ref.current[key]`. If a key is added or removed later, it reports this with `console.error` in `__DEV__`.
- Mutation check: switching the ref update to `useEffect` makes both same-commit child-effect tests fail.

**The five context modules**
- `session-context.ts` has `useSession()` and `useAccessToken()`, with the token in a second, narrow context.
- The other four are `status-context.ts`, `sync-actions-context.ts`, `surveys-context.ts` and `survey-form-context.ts`.
- Each one exports its types with `export type` and has a hook that throws `"<hook> must be used inside AppStateProvider"`.

**`useSurveySync`**
- It returns a single `useMemo` object: `{ sessionState, sessionActions, accessToken, status, syncActions, surveyOperations, surveyDetailsState }`.
- The three action groups use `useStableActions`.
- `handleDebugResetIbpData` and `handleDebugResetUserData` are now `useCallback`s with their real dependencies. Their English texts are unchanged.
- `operationStatus` is internal (`const [, setOperationStatus]`).

**`AppStateProvider.tsx` (`useAppController`)**
- It holds what `App.tsx` held before:
  - the `apiUrl` state and the dev-tools stored-URL effect;
  - `formMode`, `editingSurveyId` and `surveyDetailTab`;
  - every hook call, including `useGpsCapture` with a stable `onAlert` that calls `Alert.alert`;
  - `surveyStats`, `ownSurveyIds` and `editingSurveyVisibility`;
  - the bootstrap effect, and `openSurvey` (the old `handleOpenSurvey`).
- `closeSurveyDetailSelection` and the `onStopEditing` closure are now stable `useCallback`s.
- Each context value is a `useMemo` over its own fields. The providers are nested in this order: session, access token, status, sync actions, surveys, form.

**`App.tsx`**
- It keeps the gesture and safe-area shell, then `<AppStateProvider><AppShell/></AppStateProvider>`.
- `AppShell` reads `useSession()` for the three overlays and keeps `profileSetupSkipped` as local state.
- `container` and `appLayout` moved into the local StyleSheet. The `./src/app/styles` import is gone.

**`AuthenticatedAppNavigation`**
- It has no props. At its top it reads the five contexts and `useAccessToken()`, and calls `usePublicMapExplorer({ apiUrl, onStatusChange: setStatus })`.
- It rebuilds the old `surveyForm`, `surveyList` and `surveySync` shapes for the internal navigators. Their type aliases are now built from the context types, and the internal components are unchanged. The only edit is `accessToken ?? ""` on `AccountScreen`.

**Coverage rows**
- `./src/state/` is set at 95 / 75 / 87 / 97 and `./src/i18n/` at 100 / 100 / 100 / 100, both the measured floors.
- `./App.tsx` goes up from 79 / 65 / 56 / 83 to 100 / 100 / 100 / 100, because the overlay tests in `contexts.test.tsx` render the whole shell.

## Render counts (after this plan)

These are identical to the pre-phase baseline for all five scenarios. `render-counts.test.tsx` was not modified.

| Scenario | home | surveyList | surveyDetail | surveyForm | factorDetail | parcelSelection | publicMap | account | settings | rows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| initialMount | 2 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 19 |
| statusUpdate | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |
| formKeystroke | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |
| formKeystrokeAutosave | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 38 |
| oneSurveyRefresh | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 19 |

The plan expected no change: the navigation component still reads every context at its top and uses render callbacks. The layer below does change. `contexts.test.tsx` shows that a status update now changes only the status value, and a keystroke changes only the form value. Plan 01.9-18 can therefore bring the counts down by giving each screen its own route component.

## Tests

- `useLatestCallback.test.ts` has 6 tests:
  - the callback and the action object keep their identity and call the latest implementation;
  - two same-commit child-effect tests (W1);
  - a key added or removed after the first render is reported.
- `contexts.test.tsx` has 18 tests:
  - Part 1: the 6 hooks throw outside the provider.
  - Part 2 renders the real assembler. It checks that `useSurveySync` is called once per provider render, and that the session value holds no token (T-01.9-17).
  - Part 2 then checks identities: a status update changes only the status value, a keystroke changes only the form value, and the sync-actions, surveys-actions and session-actions objects never change identity.
  - Part 2 also covers `openSurvey`/`closeSurveyDetailSelection` and `setApiUrl`.
  - Part 3 renders the App shell overlays: no overlay, the auth gate, the owner conflict (switch and discard) and the profile setup (save and skip).
- `useSurveySync.test.ts` goes from 43 to 49 cases. Only property paths changed, except for the following:
  - the "all properties" test became a slice-shape test;
  - the `operationStatus` assertion now checks that the internal status is passed into the next update;
  - new tests check slice identity, that `setStatus` changes only `status`, that the debug resets keep their identity when `surveys` changes, and that a stable reset runs the latest `apiUrl`.
- `useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts`, `sync-owner-gate.test.ts` and `hooks/survey-sync/*` are unchanged (`git diff --quiet`) and pass.
- Full mobile suite with coverage: 64 suites and 841 tests pass, and every threshold is met.
- Lint shows 0 errors (the 356 `jsx-no-literals` warnings were already there), and `npm run typecheck` passes.
- `format:check` passes, and `prettier --check` passes on the changed TS/TSX files.
- `expo export --platform ios` bundles 1405 modules.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Flat stable actions kept on useSurveySync's return**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** `useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` must stay unchanged, and it calls `result.current.handleLogout()` and `result.current.handleSync()` at the top level. The contract's slice-only return would break it.
- **Fix:** the memoised return object also spreads `sessionActions` and `syncActions`. Every member is stable, so this adds no re-render. New code should read the slices.
- **Commit:** 816766a

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] `container` and `appLayout` deleted from `src/app/styles.ts`**
- **Found during:** Task 3
- **Issue:** after the move, the two keys were unused. The 01.9-04 structure ratchet (`src/__checks__/structure.test.ts`) failed at 303 unused style keys against a ceiling of 301. The now-unused `brandColors` import also failed lint.
- **Fix:** the plan says these styles "move" into App.tsx, so the two keys and the import were deleted from `styles.ts`. The file is not in `files_modified`, and no other wave-2 plan touches it.
- **Commit:** 9437f1c

**3. [Rule 2] App shell overlay tests in `contexts.test.tsx`**
- **Issue:** App.tsx now has only 6 functions, 4 of them overlay callbacks that the harness never reaches (its user is signed in and has a name). Function coverage fell to 33 %, below the 56 % row, and rows must never be lowered.
- **Fix:** Part 3 of `contexts.test.tsx` renders `App` with the navigation mocked and covers every overlay path. App.tsx is now at 100 % and its row went up to 100.

**4. Task 2 commit is not type-clean on its own**
- Commit 816766a reshapes `useSurveySync`. App.tsx and the navigation only switched to the contexts in 9437f1c, so `tsc` fails at 816766a alone. The hook suites were green at that commit, and the plan's final state (9437f1c) passes every check.

**5. `useAccessToken` value shape**
- The context value is `{ accessToken: string | null }`, not a bare string, so the hook can both return `null` for "no token" and throw outside the provider. An empty token maps to `null`.

## Threat model

- **T-01.9-17:** the token is only in `AccessTokenContext`. A test checks that the session state has no `accessToken` key and no value equal to the token.
- **T-01.9-18:** there is one `useSurveySync(` call, in `AppStateProvider.tsx`. A test checks that the provider calls it once per render. App.tsx has 0 calls.
- **T-01.9-19:** the sub-hooks and the `syncAllowed` wiring are untouched, and `sync-owner-gate.test.ts` is unchanged and green.

## Known Stubs

None.
