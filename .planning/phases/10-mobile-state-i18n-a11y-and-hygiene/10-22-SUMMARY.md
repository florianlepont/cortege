# Phase 01.9 Plan 22: Virtualised survey list with memoised rows Summary

The survey list is now an `Animated.FlatList` of `memo(SurveyRow)` rows. `useSurveyList` keeps the previous survey objects across SQLite refreshes (`shareUnchanged`). With 500 surveys, only the initial window of rows mounts, and replacing one survey re-renders exactly one row. In the render harness, a keystroke followed by autosave and a one-survey refresh each re-render one row. Before this plan each re-rendered 19.

## What was built

**`survey-list/SurveyRow.tsx`**
- `memo` with a comparator:
  - `survey`, `selected`, `onOpen` and `onDelete` compare by identity.
  - `preview` compares shallowly (attachment id, kind, uri).
- The `Swipeable` ref is a local `useRef`, which replaces the `let swipeableRef` closure.
- `onDelete(survey.id)` and `onOpen(survey.id)` are called from `useCallback` handlers inside the row.
- It uses `formatSyncErrorForUser(last_sync_error, last_sync_error_code)`. The old dead `?? supportText` fallback is gone.
- Texts and labels come from `fr.surveyList`:
  - `row.deleteAction`
  - `row.updatedMeta(date)`
  - `a11y.deleteSurvey(name)`
  - `a11y.openSurvey({ name, status, updatedAt })`
- Moved here from the screen: `SurveyBadge`, `resolveSurveyRowTone`, and the row styles (now in `row-styles.ts`). The moved keys were deleted from the screen.
- The unused `attentionList` key was also deleted, so `unused-styles` reports 0.

**`SurveyListScreen.tsx`** (1,772 → 1,634 lines; 01.9-27 splits it)
- `Animated.FlatList` settings:
  - `data = [...leadingItems, ...mainListSurveys]`
  - a module-level `keyExtractor`
  - `renderItem` from `useCallback([previewById, selectedSurveyId, onOpenSurvey, onDeleteSurvey])`
  - `ListHeaderComponent` = memoised filters bar (sticky index 0)
  - `ListFooterComponent` = memoised empty states and bottom spacer
  - `refreshControl`, `onScroll` and `handleRefresh` are memoised
- `previewById` is derived once from `attachmentsBySurvey`.
- `visibleAttentionSurveys` is memoised.
- `triggerHaptic` moved to `survey-list/haptics.ts`, which the screen and the rows share.

**`SurveyListRoute.tsx`**: unchanged. `onOpenSurvey` is already a `useLatestCallback`, and `onDeleteSurvey` is the stable `actions.confirmDeleteSurvey`.

**`useSurveyList.ts`**
- `shareUnchanged(prev, next)`, exported and pure: for each next row it keeps the previous object with the same id when every own field is `Object.is`-equal. It returns `prev` itself when the length, the order and every element are unchanged.
- `refreshLocalSurveys` calls `setSurveys((prev) => shareUnchanged(prev, rows))`. It is the only `setSurveys` path.

## Render counts

`RENDER_COUNTS_OUT=/tmp/render-counts-p19-22.json`, and the plan's node check passes.

| Scenario | before (pre-phase) rows | after 01.9-18 rows | after 01.9-22 rows | screens after 01.9-22 (home/list/detail/form/factor/parcel/map/account/settings) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| initialMount | 19 | 19 | **10** | 2/2/0/1/1/1/2/1/1 |
| statusUpdate | 19 | 0 | **0** | 0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/1 |
| formKeystroke | 19 | 0 | **0** | 0/0/0/1/1/1/0/0/0 |
| formKeystrokeAutosave | 38 | 19 | **1** | 1/1/1/1/1/1/1/0/0 |
| oneSurveyRefresh | 19 | 19 | **1** | 1/1/1/0/0/0/1/0/0 |

- Screen counts are unchanged from 01.9-18. Every `EXPECTED` change is a decrease.
- **formKeystrokeAutosave = 1 row.**
  - The autosave rewrites s-01's `updated_at`, so s-01 becomes the "continue draft" card.
  - The previous card, s-20, re-enters the list as a new row. That new row is the one render.
  - The edited s-01 is not a list row.
- **oneSurveyRefresh = 1 row**, the renamed survey.
  - Home, list, detail and map still re-render once because they read the surveys context. The surveys array really changed: one survey was renamed.
    - Home shows stats.
    - Detail resolves the selected survey.
    - Map reads `ownSurveyIds`.
  - None of them re-render on a refresh that changes nothing, because `shareUnchanged` returns `prev`.
- Measured after Task 1 alone (FlatList and memo, no sharing): initialMount 10, autosave 10, refresh 10. Every visible row still re-rendered, because each SQLite read returned fresh objects. That confirms B6.

## Verification

- `survey-list-500.test.tsx` has 8 tests:
  - ≤ 10 rows mount out of 500;
  - replacing one survey re-renders 1 row with the same `renderItem`;
  - a parent re-render with equal props re-renders 0 rows with the same `renderItem`;
  - selecting an off-screen survey re-renders 0 rows;
  - a selection change re-renders 2 rows;
  - delete calls `onDelete` with the row's own id and closes the Swipeable (T-01.9-41);
  - row labels come from the catalogue and contain no id, and open passes the id;
  - one preview per survey.
  - RED was checked by running the suite against the pre-plan screen: 8 of 8 fail.
- `useSurveyList.test.ts` has 20 tests, 9 of them new: 2 for refresh sharing and 7 for `shareUnchanged`. The suite failed to compile before `shareUnchanged` existed.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 71 suites and 941 tests pass. Every threshold holds, and the command exits 0.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (62 warnings, down from 66).
- `npm run typecheck`: passes.
- `npm run format:check`: passes.
- `npx expo export --platform android` bundles 1,452 modules.
- Gates:
  - `structure-report literals src/screens/survey-list`: 0.
  - `unused-styles src/screens/SurveyListScreen.tsx src/screens/survey-list`: 0.
  - `eslint src/screens/survey-list --max-warnings 0`: passes.
- Greps:
  - `Animated.FlatList`: 1
  - `mainListSurveys.map`: 0
  - `let swipeableRef`: 0
  - `memo(` in SurveyRow: 1
  - `shareUnchanged` in useSurveyList.ts: 2

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 1] Header layout: the sticky filters bar only, and the cards as leading items**
- **Issue:** the plan puts the hero spacer, filters, attention section and continue card in one `ListHeaderComponent`. A FlatList can only make whole cells sticky, so that header would stick as a block, and the filters bar would no longer stick by itself as it did (sticky index 1).
- **Fix:**
  - The header is the filters bar.
  - The create card, the "À faire" card and the section header are leading data items that carry a prebuilt element.
  - The spacer became content `paddingTop`, with the negative margin moved into that padding, so the sticky cell starts at the same y.
  - Empty states moved to `ListFooterComponent`, because `data` always holds the leading items.
- **Consequence:** `initialNumToRender` is the number of leading items + 10, so exactly 10 rows mount.

**2. [Rule 1] `useNativeDriver: false` kept**
- The plan's `true` would crash: the hero interpolates `height`, which the native driver does not animate.

**3. `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` not added**
- The ScrollView never had it, and adding it would change behaviour.

**4. Harness refresh scenario renames s-17 instead of s-06**
- The plan asks to "seed it so" the changed survey is in the first 10 rows. s-06 is row 15 after the autosave reorder, which would give 0 rows.
- Only this index, `EXPECTED` and the header comment changed in the harness.

**5. Extra file `survey-list/haptics.ts`**
- `triggerHaptic` is shared by the screen and the rows.

**6. [Environment] node_modules symlinks**
- Untracked symlinks to the main checkout were used for the checks. They were never staged and were removed at the end.
- No package was added or removed.

## Threat model

- **T-01.9-40:** handled by the virtualised FlatList, memo rows and structural sharing. The 500-survey test holds.
- **T-01.9-41:** the row calls `onDelete(survey.id)` with its own prop. The test asserts the id for row 5 of 500.

## Known Stubs

None.
