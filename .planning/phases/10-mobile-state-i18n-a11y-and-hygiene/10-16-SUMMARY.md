# Phase 01.9 Plan 16: Home under 400 lines, components and ui in French Summary

HomeScreen drops from 409 to 199 lines. The sector score block is now `screens/home/SectorScoreCard.tsx` and the styles are in `screens/home/styles.ts`. Every string on Home, the cards, the splash screen and the ui primitives now comes from `fr.home`, `fr.components` or `fr.common`.

## Tasks

| Task | Commit | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | f4c1683 | Split Home: SectorScoreCard and styles.ts, text moved to fr.home |
| 2 | 1f8302e | Cards, splash and ui primitives read from fr.components; DraftCard test asserts catalogue values |

## Final files

- `mobile/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` (199 lines, same export `HomeScreen` and same props)
- `mobile/src/screens/home/SectorScoreCard.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/home/styles.ts` (all Home styles; 0 unused keys)

## Details

- Home: the inline `labelStyle={{ color: brandColors.canvas }}` is now the `heroButtonLabel` style key. The "Voir carte" Pressable now has `accessibilityRole="button"` and an `accessibilityLabel`.
- The sector dot colour is computed once per render, not once per dot. The output is the same.
- TypewriterSplash: the Latin species names are now `fr.components.splash.species`. The cursor `|`, the loading text and the accessibility label also come from the catalogue.
- ui primitives: only the fallback and default texts moved. These are AppButton `"Action"`, the AppCollapsibleSection toggle label, and IbpScoreBadge `"/10"` and `"—"`.
- **ui files not touched.** No scanner or eslint rule flagged them: AppField, AppNotice, AppSectionHeader, AppStatusChip, AppSettingsRow, AppChoiceChip.
- **Unused styles.** The unused-styles scanner already reported 0 for `src/components` and `src/ui` before this plan, so no keys were deleted there. `styles[variant]` usage is unchanged.
- `ParcelOverlayPolygons.tsx` and `IgnCadastreTileOverlay.tsx` were not touched, because no scanner flagged them.

## Verification

- For `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx src/screens/home src/components src/ui`, all gates are at 0:
  - `structure-report.js long-files|unused-styles|literals --max 0`
  - `npx eslint … --max-warnings 0`
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 62 suites and 815 tests pass, and the coverage thresholds pass.
- The DraftCard suite has 8 tests: the 4 existing ones, now asserting catalogue values, and 4 new ones for the progress label, the untitled fallback, the blocked text and the relative times. `catalogue.test.ts` is green with the new leaves.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` all exit 0.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 1 - Text] Plural agreement.** Home's "N relevés analysés" was always plural. The catalogue function now agrees with the count ("1 relevé analysé"). All other texts are unchanged.
2. **[Rule 2 - a11y] "Voir carte" link.** The Pressable had no role or label. It now has a button role and an accessibility label from `fr.home.nearby.seeMapLabel`.
3. **Scope note.** The plan's Task 2 asked to delete the unused style keys in components and ui. There were none (the scanner reported 0 before any change).

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. This plan only moves presentational text and styles.

## Self-Check: PASSED
