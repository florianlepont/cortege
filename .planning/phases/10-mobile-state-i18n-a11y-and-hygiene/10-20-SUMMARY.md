decisions:
  - "useLocalDataOwner shows no text. Its 8 scanner hits were its owner-check state setter being named setStatus, so that setter is now setOwnerStatus. The owner texts live in fr.status.owner and are used by the network hook (gate messages) and useSurveySync (discard alert)"
  - "The logout and delete-account texts of useSurveySync go in fr.status.session (they are session texts), not in sync.ts"
  - "The initial status is fr.status.session.ready() ('Prêt'), shared by useSurveySync's initial state and useAuth0Session's no-credentials restore"
  - "A finished sync reports sent / failed / received counts (pulled surveys + attachments summed); the auto-sync trigger name (reconnected, heartbeat...) and the pull page count are no longer shown, so runSync lost its unused trigger parameter"
  - "Login failures return fr.status.session.loginFailed() to the auth gate instead of 'Login error: <raw>'. The dev-only Auth0 diagnostics of app/auth0-config.ts (buildAuth0UnauthorizedMessage, buildApiTokenRejectedMessage) and EMAIL_ALREADY_LINKED_MESSAGE (auth-errors.ts, already French) are unchanged: those files are outside this plan"
  - "The cancelled-login reportStatus('auth', 'idle', '') keeps its empty text: an empty entry would fail the catalogue walker, and 01.9-29 owns the setStatus type"
  - "The `profile` string of useAuth0Session ('Not logged in' / 'name (email)') is not a status or Alert text; it only feeds the avatar initials fallback, so it is unchanged"

# Phase 01.9 Plan 20: Session, owner, network and central sync texts on the French catalogue Summary

The session, owner, network and central sync hooks now take every status line and Alert text from `fr.status.session`, `fr.status.owner`, `fr.status.sync` and `fr.status.debug`. That includes the debug-reset dialogs and the initial status. No message contains a survey id, an error code or raw error text. The detail goes to `logStatusDetail`, which only logs in dev builds.

## Results

| Check | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `literals` scanner, useAuth0Session.ts | 15 | 0 |
| `literals` scanner, useLocalDataOwner.ts | 8 | 0 |
| `literals` scanner, useSurveySyncNetwork.ts | 13 | 0 |
| `literals` scanner, useSurveySync.ts | 36 | 0 |
| `status-ids` scanner, useAuth0Session.ts | 1 | 0 |
| `status-ids` scanner, useLocalDataOwner.ts | 0 | 0 |
| `status-ids` scanner, useSurveySyncNetwork.ts | 2 | 0 |
| `status-ids` scanner, useSurveySync.ts | 8 | 0 |
| `test(` count, useAuth0Session.test.ts | 27 | 33 |
| `test(` count, useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts | 26 | 27 |
| `test(` count, useSurveySync.test.ts | 49 | 50 |
| `spyOn(React` in useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts | 0 | 0 |

The whole-`src` counts are now `literals` 157 and `status-ids` 19. The other open wave-3 plans own what is left.

## Tests

- **useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts.** Every case is kept, and only the asserted strings changed: `stringContaining("Sync complete")`, "Login required", "Network timeout" and the other English strings now compare with `fr.status.sync.*` / `fr.status.owner.*` values. The generic-error cases now expect `text.failed()` / `text.pullFailed()` / `text.reportFailed()` instead of the raw error text. One new case checks that the raw error text never reaches the status. A `console.debug` spy keeps the `logStatusDetail` output out of the test logs.
- **useSurveySync.test.ts.** The `STATUS` constant block now holds catalogue values. Its id/message-taking functions became constants, because the texts no longer carry them, and `debugError(title, msg)` became `debugIbpError` / `debugUserError`. The `"Cancel"` / `"Reset"` button literals are now `STATUS.cancelButton` / `STATUS.resetButton`. One new case: a failed account deletion shows the catalogue status and alert and never the raw error. The `console.debug` spy was added here too.
- **useAuth0Session.test.ts.** It asserted no English status text. It gets a `console.debug` spy and a new `describe` block with 6 cases: ready at launch, expired-session restore, login failure hiding the raw error, logged in, profile-load failure hiding the error, and logged out.
- **useLocalDataOwner.test.ts.** No change needed.
- **01.5 safety nets.** `git diff` for `useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` and `sync-owner-gate.test.ts` is empty. They assert no message literal, so neither file was edited.

## Verification

- The plan's scanner gates are at 0 for all four hook files, as shown in the table above.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 68 suites and 903 tests pass, and the thresholds hold. Line coverage is 100% for `src/i18n/fr/status`, 94.7% for useSurveySync.ts, 87.2% for useSurveySyncNetwork.ts, 74.4% for useAuth0Session.ts and 91.3% for useLocalDataOwner.ts.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 66 warnings, all pre-existing.
- `npm run typecheck` is clean, and `npm run format:check` is clean.
- The catalogue walker (`src/i18n/catalogue.test.ts`) checks the new entries for empty text and id patterns, and it passes.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 3 - Blocking] The worktree had no `node_modules`.** Jest could not resolve `expo-network`, so `mobile/node_modules` and `api/node_modules` are symlinked to the main checkout's folders. They are untracked, were never staged, and are removed before hand-off.
2. **Scope placement.** The logout and account-deletion texts of useSurveySync.ts went to `fr/status/session.ts`, which Task 1 created, instead of `sync.ts` or `debug.ts`. The owner-gate texts went to `fr/status/owner.ts`, which the network hook reads. Every file touched is still in the plan's `files_modified` list.

The decisions above record the other calls the plan left open.
