# Phase 01.9 Plan 07: Public map items by bbox Summary

**`GET /v1/public/map-items` takes an optional `bbox`. It is an EXISTS on the linked parcels' generated centroid columns (via `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng`), inside the limit-first subquery. Without `bbox` the SQL is byte-identical to before. It is covered by unit tests, a new E2E spec with EXPLAIN, the contract doc and production probes.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** about 45 min
- **Completed:** 2026-09-26
- **Tasks:** 2/2
- **Files modified:** 7 (1 created)

## Accomplishments

- `PublicMapItemsQueryDto.bbox`: `@IsOptional() @IsString() @MaxLength(128)`, copied from the parcel-statuses DTO.
- `PublicMapService.getPublicMapItems` parses it with `parseBbox`. A malformed value throws its fixed-message 400 before any query, and a blank value means no bbox.
- `buildPublicMapItemsQuery` adds a `bbox` filter that goes after `from`/`to`/`region`. It is written as `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM survey_parcels sp JOIN parcels p ... p.centroid_lng BETWEEN $n::double precision AND ... p.centroid_lat BETWEEN ...)` inside the LIMIT 500 subquery. `PUBLIC_SURVEY_PREDICATE` stays first and `PUBLIC_MAP_ITEMS_LIMIT` is unchanged.
- Unit tests:
  - A literal snapshot of the pre-01.9 SQL shows the text and values are identical with no bbox, with `bbox: null`, and with all three old filters.
  - The bbox predicate and its parameter numbering are checked.
  - The service passes the parsed bbox to the query.
  - All three parseBbox messages reject with nothing sent to the database.
  - A blank bbox is treated as no bbox.
- New `api/test/public-map-bbox.e2e-spec.ts` (7 tests). `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` is untouched.
  1. Without bbox, the HTTP answer equals the no-bbox query run directly and mapped with `toPublicMapItem`.
  2. With a bbox:
     - the public survey inside the box is returned with rounded `display_location`;
     - the public survey outside and the private survey inside are excluded;
     - `region` still combines with it;
     - a box around the outside parcel flips the result.
  3. A blank bbox behaves like no bbox.
  4. All three malformed shapes (`a,b,c,d`, `1,2`, reversed bounds) return 400 with the exact message, and the body does not contain the input.
  5. 129 characters return 400 from the ValidationPipe with no echo. 128 characters pass the DTO.
  6. EXPLAIN on the 10 000-survey seed from `scripts/explain-public-routes.js`, in a rolled-back transaction (see "EXPLAIN findings").
  7. On the same seed, the bbox query returns the same survey set as a reference query built from JOIN plus DISTINCT, without EXISTS.
- Contract doc: the `/public/map-items` entry now documents `bbox`. It covers the format with an example, the centroid rule, fixed 400s without echo, the 128-character cap, blank equals absent, no bbox equals the previous answer, and the 500 cap with or without bbox.
- `owner-check-simulation.mjs production` has two new read-only probes: a mainland-France bbox returns 200 with an `items` array, and `bbox=not-a-bbox` returns 400 with no echo in the raw body. The header comment is updated.

## EXPLAIN findings (10 000 surveys, 8 000 parcels, 19 794 links)

| Query | Plan | Time |
|---|---|---|
| bbox 1° (`EXPLAIN_BBOX` 2-3 E, 48-49 N) | Bitmap Index Scan `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng` feeds a hash join with a **Seq Scan on survey_parcels**. That result feeds a hash semi join with an Index Scan `idx_surveys_public_submitted`, then LIMIT and the LATERAL aggregate | 5.6 ms |
| same + `region=ACA` | same shape | 4.2 ms |
| same + `from`/`to` | Index Scan `idx_surveys_public_submitted`, then a nested-loop semi join probing `survey_parcels_pkey` and `parcels_parcel_id_key` (the planner cannot estimate `submitted_at::date`, so it expects about 2 rows). No seq scan, no centroid index | 18 ms |
| city box (2.3-2.4 E, 48.8-48.9 N) | Index Scan `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng`, then `idx_survey_parcels_parcel_id`, then `surveys_pkey`. Fully index-driven | 0.1 ms |
| whole France (-5..9 E, 41..52 N) | The box matches every parcel, so the planner seq-scans parcels and survey_parcels for the hash (correct for a non-selective range). With `region` it switches to a nested loop that stops at 500 | 20 ms / 5.5 ms |
| no bbox | Unchanged: `idx_surveys_public_submitted` + `survey_parcels_pkey`, no seq scan, no centroid index | - |

The spec checks four things:
- For the 1° box, with no filter, `region` and `from`/`to`, there is no Seq Scan on `parcels` or `surveys`. `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng` is required for the first two variants and `idx_surveys_public_submitted` for all three.
- The city box has no seq scan at all.
- The no-bbox query has no seq scan and does not touch the centroid index.

I did not need `enable_seqscan = off`. Production code has no hints.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: bbox in DTO, service and query builder with unit and E2E tests.** `33e8052` (feat). The unit tests were written first and failed to compile, since `bbox` was not on the filter or input types. The E2E spec was also written before the implementation.
2. **Task 2: Contract doc, simulation probes and full API suites.** `44a62ab` (docs).

## Verification

- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 29 suites, **636 passed**. Coverage: 82.28 % statements, 71.24 % branches, 75.32 % functions, 83.04 % lines.
- Full E2E on `ibp_p19_07_test` with `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` unset, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`:
  - local storage: 25 suites, **177 passed, 3 skipped** (MinIO-only);
  - MinIO mode (`pgsty/minio` pinned digest, container `p19-07-minio` on port 19800, removed afterwards): 25 suites, **179 passed, 1 skipped**.
- Targeted run `public-map-bbox|public-routes-explain`: 18/18.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` are clean. `prettier --check` on the six changed code files is clean. `node --check scripts/owner-check-simulation.mjs` passes.
- Simulation replay: I ran `production` against the built API on port 3107 (test mode, `ibp_p19_07_test`). Both new bbox probes PASS. The debug-token, CORS and MinIO-health checks FAIL, as expected for a test-mode local API without MinIO. Against production they apply after deploy.
- Acceptance checks:
  - `MaxLength(128)` appears once in the DTO.
  - `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` is not changed.
  - `PUBLIC_MAP_ITEMS_LIMIT` appears 2 times in `public-map.queries.ts`, as before.
  - `bbox` appears 7 times in the simulation.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **The EXPLAIN assertion is narrower than "no seq scan anywhere".** At the 1° box, the planner hashes about 180 parcel links against a Seq Scan on `survey_parcels`, which is a costed choice (about 1.5 ms over 20 000 rows). The plan's truth only requires no Seq Scan on parcels, so the spec checks exactly that, plus surveys. A city-sized box, which is what the map sends when zoomed in, is checked to be fully index-driven. With `from`/`to`, the planner walks the survey index and probes parcels by key, so the centroid index is only required for the no-filter and `region` variants. The findings table records all of this.
2. **The EXPLAIN uses the shared 10 000-survey seed instead of the handful of HTTP-seeded rows.** On a few rows, any plan is a seq scan. Reusing `explain.seed` in a rolled-back transaction, as `public-routes-explain` does, gives a meaningful plan without planner hints.
3. **The docs file was left unformatted.** `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md` already failed `prettier --check` before this plan, and `format:check` covers only ts/tsx/json, so I did not reformat the whole file.

No bugs were found and nothing was auto-fixed.

## Issues Encountered

- At country scale (a whole-France bbox at low zoom), the planner correctly seq-scans parcels because the range matches every row. Production has fewer parcels than the seed, and the 500 cap still bounds the output. The mobile plan should send the bbox only at the zooms where it narrows, or accept this cost, which is about 20 ms on the seed.

## Next Phase Readiness

- The mobile viewport loading can call `fetchPublicMapItems` with `bbox`, and older app versions keep the unfiltered answer.
- When 01.8 splits the idempotency spec into `public-map.e2e-spec.ts`, `public-map-bbox.e2e-spec.ts` can stay separate or be merged into it.
