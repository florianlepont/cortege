# Phase 01.9 Plan 26: Native tabs and search docs Summary

The native README now has a "Native tabs" section covering the 01.9-25 behaviour. User story US-E2 now says that search is the header search of « Mes Relevés », with no separate search tab.

## What was done

**Task 1: `mobile/README-native.md`, "Native tabs" section**
- The 4-tab layout (Accueil, Mes Relevés, Explorer, Compte), and which library draws each bar.
- A table of the reason codes `platform`, `expo-go`, `env-opt-out` and `ok`, listed in the order `getNativeTabsAvailability()` in `src/navigation/native-tabs-availability.ts` checks them.
- Where the one-time log appears (Metro for dev builds; the Xcode console or Console.app for Release builds), with the exact `console.warn` and `console.info` lines.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false` now only applies to dev builds. A Release build on iPhone always uses the native bar.
- The likely cause of the old Release fallback, from the 01.9-25 investigation: a leftover opt-out in the local `mobile/.env` got inlined into the bundle.
- The shared `shouldHideTabBar` rule: the bar is hidden on `surveyParcels` in both trees. The section explains how each tree applies it and how to add a route.

**Task 2: US-E2**
- Search lives in « Mes Relevés ». The app has four tabs and no search tab.
- New criteria for the search placement (native header bar on iPhone, inline field on Android and in Expo Go) and for active search versus cleared search.

## Verification

- Task 1 check: all of `platform`, `expo-go`, `env-opt-out`, `shouldHideTabBar` and `native-tabs-availability` are found in README-native.
- Task 2 check: "Mes Relevés" appears 4 times, and "onglet Recherche" does not appear in US-E2.
- `npm run format:check`: passes. It only covers `.ts`, `.tsx` and `.json`, so these Markdown files are not checked by it.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (62 warnings, same as before). `npm run typecheck`: passes.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 77 suites and 1,013 tests pass, exit 0, and every threshold holds.
- Render-count test (`src/state/render-counts.test.tsx`): 5 tests pass.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 1 - Plan inaccuracy] US-E2 written in English**
- The plan said the epic file was French. It is English throughout.
- The new text is English, with the French UI names « Mes Relevés », Accueil, Explorer and Compte.
- The plan's automated check still passes.

**2. [Environment]** `node_modules` symlinks to the main checkout were used for the checks. They were never staged and were removed at the end.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat model

- **T-01.9-59 (mitigated):** the README documents the dev-only opt-out and the logged reason code.

## Commits

- 97f6005 docs(01.9-26): document native tabs reason codes, dev-only opt-out and bar hiding
- 6e857c6 docs(01.9-26): US-E2 search is the Mes Relevés header search, no search tab

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `mobile/README-native.md` and `docs/specs/epic-e-data-quality-and-trust.md` are modified.
- Commits 97f6005 and 6e857c6 are in `git log`.
