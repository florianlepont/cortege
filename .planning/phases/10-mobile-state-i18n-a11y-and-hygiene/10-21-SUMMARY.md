# Phase 01.9 Plan 21: Hook status and validation messages on the catalogue Summary

The editing, draft-patch, GPS and app-bootstrap status messages and the form validation messages now come from the French catalogue (`fr.status.editing|gps|app`, `fr.validation`). They name the survey instead of showing its id, and raw error text goes to `logStatusDetail`.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commits |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Editing and draft-patcher hooks on the catalogue | f3aae23 (RED), 6b151c6 (GREEN), 042ffc2 (prettier fix on the patcher test) |
| 2 | Validation messages on the catalogue | 3f84d66 (RED), 7a01dc6 (GREEN) |
| 3 | GPS hook and app bootstrap messages on the catalogue | d489416 |

## Verification

- Scanners at 0 (`literals` and `status-ids`) for useEditingDraft.ts, useSurveyDraftPatcher.ts, useGpsCapture.ts, useSurveyForm.ts and state/AppStateProvider.tsx. Across the whole repo: literals 114, status-ids 2 (the ratchet only allows these to stay level or go down).
- `grep -rln "spyOn(React" mobile/src` lists nothing.
- Test counts are unchanged in the five rewritten hook tests; only the asserted strings (and the patcher's `successMessage` arguments) changed. contexts.test.tsx gained one case (init failure shows the catalogue text).
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 70 suites, 925 tests passed, and every threshold holds. `src/state` was at 96.96% lines, under its 97% threshold, until the init-failure test was added. It is now at 97.97%.
- Render-count test (`src/state/render-counts.test.tsx`): 5/5 pass.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (66 warnings, all from before this plan). `npm run typecheck` passes. `npm run format:check` is clean.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] contexts.test.tsx asserted the old "Survey s-01 opened" text**
- **Found during:** Task 3
- **Fix:** It now asserts `fr.status.app.surveyOpened({ name: "Site 01" })`. The file is outside the plan's list.
- **Commit:** d489416

**2. [Rule 2 - Coverage] src/state line coverage fell to 96.96% (threshold 97%)**
- **Found during:** Task 3
- **Issue:** The two-line init-failure branch (logStatusDetail and the catalogue text) had no test.
- **Fix:** Added an AppStateProvider case where `initLocalDb` rejects. It checks that the status shows `fr.status.app.initFailed()` and not the raw error.
- **Commit:** d489416

**3. [Rule 2 - D-06] English "Unnamed site" stored as the site name**
- **Fix:** The fallback is now `fr.common.untitledSurvey`, and the patcher test title and assertion were updated.
- **Commit:** 6b151c6

**4. Validation catalogue shape: `rules.integer` added**
- **Reason:** `numberError` has an integer branch, and the test that asserts it has to keep passing.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Notes for later plans

- `fr.factorDetail.fieldLabels` (01.9-17) and the `humanizeFieldLabel` lookup in FactorDetailScreen are now redundant, because field labels arrive in French. They were left unchanged because they are outside this plan's files. They can be removed during the 01.9-32 validation re-check.

## Self-Check: PASSED
