# Phase 01.9 Plan 03: Remaining spy-based hook tests on renderHook Summary

The six remaining hook tests that spied on `React.useState`/`useCallback`/`useRef`/`useEffect`/`useMemo` now render the real hooks with `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-native/pure`. Every case and every expected message is kept. With 01.9-02 merged, no `spyOn(React` remains in `mobile/src`.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Survey operations test on renderHook | 60fcea2 | useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts |
| 2 | Profile and network tests on renderHook | d66dc00 | useSurveySyncProfile.test.ts, useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts |
| 3 | Editing, form and public-map explorer tests on renderHook | 39ee3fe | useEditingDraft.test.ts, useSurveyForm.test.ts, usePublicMapExplorer.test.ts |

## Test counts (`test(`/`it(` per file, before -> after)

| File | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts | 43 | 43 |
| survey-sync/useSurveySyncProfile.test.ts | 18 | 18 |
| survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts | 26 | 26 |
| useEditingDraft.test.ts | 16 | 16 |
| useSurveyForm.test.ts | 46 | 46 |
| usePublicMapExplorer.test.ts | 13 | 13 |

Full mobile suite with coverage: 57 suites, 757 tests passing. Thresholds held (`src/hooks` row: 86.27 % statements, 68.31 % branches, 88.11 % functions, 87.61 % lines).

## Cases whose assertion moved from an internal React call to the observable effect

Everything else is unchanged. In these `useSurveyForm.test.ts` cases the old assertion checked a mocked `useState` setter or its updater. The new one reads the state after `act()`. The expected values are the same.

- `applyDraftToForm` › "applies site_name from draft": `setSiteName("My Forest")` became `siteName === "My Forest"`.
- `applyDraftToForm` › "falls back to DEFAULT_SURVEY_FORM.siteName when site_name is missing": the test first sets "Previous site", then expects `siteName === ""`.
- `applyDraftToForm` › "normalizes parcel_ids…": now expects `selectedParcelIds` to equal `["ABC", "DEF"]`.
- `applyDraftToForm` › "handles parcel_ids that is not an array": the test first sets `["P001"]`, then expects `selectedParcelIds` to equal `[]`.
- `resetSurveyForm` › "resets siteName to default" and "resets selectedParcelIds to empty array": the tests first set a non-default value, then expect the default.
- `handleRegionChange` › both cases:
  - Before: the tests pulled the updater out of the spied `setVegetationStage` and called it by hand.
  - Now: the real updater runs. For the second case the current stage is first set to "subalpin".
  - The `normalizeVegetationStageForRegion("M", "collineen")` and `("ACA", "subalpin")` assertions are unchanged.
  - The first case also checks `regionVersion` and `vegetationStage` after the change.
- `toggleParcelSelection`, all five cases:
  - "setter not called" became "`selectedParcelIds` keeps the same reference".
  - "called with an updater" became "the state becomes `["ABC"]`".
  - The add and remove updater expectations (`["ABC"]`, `["DEF", "ABC"]`, `["DEF"]`) are now checked on the state after real toggles.

The "does not throw" cases in `useSurveyForm` keep their `expect(() => …).not.toThrow()` verbatim, now inside `await act(async () => { … })`.

In `useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts`, the "maybeAutoSync … even online with pending work" case used to force the third `useRef` to `true`. It now lets the network probe resolve online. A temporary check confirmed this state is really reached: with `syncAllowed: true`, the same case calls `hasPendingSyncWork`. So the case still tests the owner gate, not the online gate.

## Deviations from Plan

None. The plan was executed as written, and no production file changed.

## Notes

- The `withAct` helper appears twice, in the profile and public-map tests. It stays local because this plan may only touch its six files. A shared test helper could replace both copies later.
- The header of `mobile/src/hooks/useEditingDraft.autosave.test.ts` still says `useEditingDraft.test.ts` "uses the React-spy style". That is now out of date. The file is outside this plan's scope and was left as is.
- The `node_modules` symlinks created for the worktree are untracked and were not committed.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All six modified files exist, and `grep -c 'spyOn(React'` returns 0 for each.
- Commits 60fcea2, d66dc00 and 39ee3fe are in `git log`.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` and `prettier --check` on the six files all pass.
