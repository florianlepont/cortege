# Phase 01.9 Plan 19: Dependency cleanup and supercluster Summary

All of the phase's dependency changes land in one lockfile update. The root Expo leftovers (App.tsx, the Expo root tsconfig.json and the root runtime dependencies) are gone. So are the four unused API packages. `@expo/ngrok` is now a devDependency and `supercluster@9.1.0` is pinned exactly. The same 29 native modules are linked before and after the change, there is still one copy each of react, react-native and expo, and the API image builds, carries no mobile dependencies and boots.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| 1 | Autolinking baseline, removals, supercluster install, lockfile regeneration | d7dc0bc |
| 2 | After snapshot, native module diff, bundle and image checks, local gate | bc32224 |

## Package changes

**Root `package.json`:** the `dependencies` block (expo 57.0.24, react 19.2.3, react-native 0.86.3) is removed. `overrides` and `devDependencies.react-test-renderer` stay. Root `App.tsx` and `tsconfig.json` are deleted, and the `App.tsx` line is gone from `.dockerignore`. Nothing referenced the root tsconfig: `api/tsconfig.*.json` and `mobile/.eslintrc.json` all point to their own package's `./tsconfig.json`. The CI `shared` filter `tsconfig*.json` still matches the package tsconfigs, so it is harmless.

**API:** `bcryptjs`, `@nestjs/schedule`, `nodemailer` and `@types/nodemailer` are removed. Before the removal, `grep -rn "ScheduleModule\|bcrypt\|nodemailer\|@nestjs/schedule" api/src api/test api/scripts` returned nothing. The lockfile also drops the transitive packages `cron`, `luxon` and `@types/luxon`. The stale comment in both stages of `api/Dockerfile` (it described the root dependencies as Expo/React Native) now describes the new root: workspaces and overrides only.

**Mobile:** `@expo/ngrok` moves from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`, still at `^4.1.0`. `"supercluster": "9.1.0"` is added, with `kdbush@4.1.0` pulled in as a transitive dependency.

**Lockfile:** it was regenerated with `npm install --workspace mobile --save-exact supercluster@9.1.0` and then `npm install`, never edited by hand. The package entries that changed are 7 removed (`@nestjs/schedule`, `@types/luxon`, `@types/nodemailer`, `bcryptjs`, `cron`, `luxon`, `nodemailer`) and 2 added (`kdbush`, `supercluster`). `npm ci --dry-run` exits 0.

### supercluster gate (D-05, T-01.9-SC)

`npm view supercluster@9.1.0 name version repository.url maintainers scripts dependencies`:

```
name = 'supercluster'
version = '9.1.0'
repository.url = 'git://github.com/mapbox/supercluster.git'
maintainers = [ 'mapbox-npm-01 <accounts+npmjs-01@mapbox.com>', ... 'mapbox-admin <accounts@mapbox.com>',
  'mapbox-machine-user <...@mapbox.com>', 'mbx-npm-*-production <...@mapbox.com>', ..., 'mourner <agafonkin@gmail.com>' ]
scripts = { cov, test, bench, build, pretest, prepublishOnly }   # no install/preinstall/postinstall
dependencies = { kdbush: '^4.1.0', '@types/geojson': '^7946.0.16' }
```

The repository is github.com/mapbox/supercluster. All 29 maintainers are Mapbox accounts, plus `mourner` (Vladimir Agafonkin, the author). The package has no install-time scripts. The transitive `kdbush@4.1.0` is from `github.com/mourner/kdbush` and also has no install scripts. `slopcheck install` was not run.

**Where npm put it (C-9):** `node_modules/supercluster` exists and `mobile/node_modules/supercluster` does not, so npm hoisted it to the root. From `mobile/`, plan 01.9-23's Jest mapper should be `'^supercluster$': '<rootDir>/../node_modules/supercluster/dist/supercluster.js'`.

## Autolinking proof (D-09, Pitfall 13)

The snapshots are `10-autolinking-before.json`, captured before any manifest was touched, and `10-autolinking-after.json`, captured after a clean `npm ci` from the new lockfile. Each one combines `expo-modules-autolinking resolve -p android|ios --json`, `expo-modules-autolinking react-native-config -p android --json` (both run from `mobile/`) and `npm ls react react-native expo --all` (run from the root).

- **`moduleNames`:** identical, 29 entries.
  - 8 community modules: expo, react-native-auth0, react-native-bottom-tabs, react-native-gesture-handler, react-native-maps, react-native-safe-area-context, react-native-screens, react-native-svg.
  - 21 Expo modules: @expo/dom-webview, @expo/log-box, expo, expo-asset, expo-blur, expo-constants, expo-crypto, expo-file-system, expo-font, expo-haptics, expo-image, expo-image-loader, expo-image-manipulator, expo-image-picker, expo-keep-awake, expo-location, expo-modules-core, expo-modules-jsi, expo-network, expo-secure-store, expo-sqlite.
- **Expo module versions:** identical on both platforms (20 modules on android and 20 on ios).
- **`npm ls`:** the versions are unchanged (expo 57.0.24, react 19.2.3, react-native 0.86.3, react-test-renderer 19.2.3). Only the shape of the tree changed. Before, expo, react and react-native appeared as root dependencies marked `overridden`. After, they appear under `cortege-mobile` marked `overridden`. `npm ls` exits 0.
- **Physical copies:** there is exactly one `node_modules/{react,react-native,expo}/package.json` in the worktree, all at the root.

## Bundle check (T-01.9-34)

`npx expo export --platform ios --source-maps` succeeded, producing one Hermes bundle and its `.map` with 1413 sources. The source-map check from phase 01.3 found `react/index.js distinct=1` (`/node_modules/react/index.js`) and `react-native/index.js distinct=1` (`/node_modules/react-native/index.js`). supercluster does not appear in the bundle yet; 01.9-23 is the plan that imports it.

## API image check (T-01.9-35)

The image was built from `api/Dockerfile` as `cortege-api:p19-19`. The sandbox cannot reach the registry from inside a container unless it goes through the agent proxy, so the local build used a derived Dockerfile kept in the scratchpad. That file only adds `COPY --from=ccr ca-bundle.crt` and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`/`npm_config_cafile` after each `WORKDIR`, and the build ran with `--network host` and `--build-context ccr=/root/.ccr`. The committed Dockerfile is unchanged apart from the comment. CI builds the real file on the PR.

The smokes reuse the `ci.yml` image-check commands:

- **Non-root:** `id -u` prints `1000`.
- **No mobile dependencies:** `node_modules/expo` and `node_modules/react-native` are absent. `ls node_modules` (161 entries) contains none of react-native, expo, react, bcryptjs, nodemailer, supercluster, cron, luxon or kdbush.
- **Image contents:** `node_modules/@nestjs` holds common, config, core, platform-express and throttler (no schedule). `du -sh node_modules` reports 82.9M.
- **Healthcheck:** configured, and it targets `/v1/health`.
- **Boot:** the container ran with the ci.yml environment (NODE_ENV=test, synthetic cadastre, local storage) on the host network. It applied migrations, logged "Nest application successfully started", and `GET /v1/health` returned `200 {"status":"ok","service":"cortege-api",...}`. A Postgres 16 was already running on the host at :5432, so the smoke used its `ibp_test` database: it applied pending migrations 014 and 015 there. That database is disposable, because E2E globalSetup drops it and migrates it again on every run. The `postgres:16` container I started for the smoke could not bind its port and exited; both smoke containers were removed afterwards.

## Tab libraries (D-08, RESEARCH Pitfall 12)

None of the three tab packages is unused, so criterion 5's "unused tab library" has nothing to remove, by owner decision:

- `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` is imported in `mobile/src/app/AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx:16` (`createBottomTabNavigator`, used for Android and as the JS fallback).
- `@bottom-tabs/react-navigation` is required lazily at `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx:177-179` (`createNativeBottomTabNavigator`, the native iOS bar).
- `react-native-bottom-tabs` is imported in `mobile/src/app/useAppBottomTabBarHeight.ts:2` and is autolinked as a native community module.

## Local gate

- **`npm run lint`:** 0 errors, 66 warnings (all pre-existing).
- **`npm run typecheck`:** exit 0 (mobile `tsc --noEmit` plus the API build).
- **`npm run test:unit`:** API 29 suites / 638 tests passed; mobile 68 suites / 903 tests passed.
- **`npm run test:coverage:mobile`:** exit 0 and the thresholds hold (All files: 70.54 statements, 52.39 branches, 67.27 functions, 71.26 lines).
- **`npm run format:check`:** all files pass.
- **`npm audit --audit-level=high`:** exit 0. There are 25 moderate findings, the same count as `npm audit --package-lock-only` on the previous lockfile, and no high or critical ones.

**Native builds:** these are not re-run locally, because this sandbox has no Xcode or Android SDK. The baseline is run [36239341355](https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36239341355), where both native jobs succeeded. The autolinking module set is identical to the pre-change tree (captured at 186b3d9, not at the baseline commit 14be3a1), and the only native-adjacent changes are the removals of root-owned copies (still hoisted identically) and a JS-only package. The PR run planned in 01.9-31 re-proves both native jobs.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 3 - Blocking] Docker build through the sandbox proxy.** The first `docker build` failed in `npm ci` with "Exit handler never called" because the container had no route to the registry. I built with a derived Dockerfile, kept only in the scratchpad, that adds the proxy CA, together with `--network host`. The repository Dockerfile was not changed for this. This affects local verification only.
2. **Export output path.** The plan names `/tmp/expo-export-p19-19`; I used the session scratchpad instead, as the environment requires. The command is otherwise the same.
3. **Boot smoke database.** The smoke used the host's already-running Postgres `ibp_test` instead of a dedicated container (see above). Its outcome is the same as the CI step.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. The surface is smaller: the API image no longer ships bcryptjs, @nestjs/schedule, cron, luxon or nodemailer.
