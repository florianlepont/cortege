# Phase 01.9 Plan 04: Structure scanners and lint gates Summary

A CommonJS script built on the installed TypeScript compiler API measures the four structure counts of phase 01.9: unused StyleSheet keys, files over 400 lines, user-facing literals and status messages that leak ids or raw error text. A Jest ratchet guards those counts, and two ESLint overrides at warn level cover hard-coded text (D-06) and Pressable accessibility (D-07).

## Baseline counts (pre-phase tree, scope `mobile/src` + `mobile/App.tsx`)

| Check | CLI | Count | Research figure |
|-------|-----|-------|-----------------|
| Unused StyleSheet keys | `unused-styles` | **301** (263 before App.tsx was in scope) | 301 |
| Files over 400 lines (screens/, navigation/, AuthenticatedAppNavigation) | `long-files` | **10** | 10 |
| User-facing literals | `literals` | **635** in 34 files | 552 in 36 files |
| Status calls leaking ids / raw error text | `status-ids` | **66** | not measured |
| Pressables without role or label, D-07 scope | ESLint | **22** Pressables (21 without `accessibilityRole`, 22 without `accessibilityLabel`) | n/a |
| Pressables without role or label, whole app | ad-hoc AST count | 30 of 43 (24 without role, 30 without label) | n/a |

These figures are the `BASELINE` constant in `structure.test.ts`: `{ unusedStyleKeys: 301, longFiles: 10, literals: 635, statusIdLeaks: 66 }`.

Unused keys by file: `src/app/styles.ts` 261, `SurveyDetailScreen.styles.ts` 25, `SurveyFormScreen.styles.ts` 14, `SurveyListScreen.tsx` 1. These match research exactly.

Long files: AuthenticatedAppNavigation 961, SurveyListScreen 1772, SurveyDetailScreen 1344, SurveyFormScreen 1190, SurveyDetailScreen.styles 836, PublicMapScreen 754, AuthGateScreen 752, SurveyFormScreen.styles 644, AccountScreen 596, HomeScreen 409.

### Why the literal count is 635 and not 552

The counts by kind are: jsx-prop 176, jsx-text 155, status 151, object-label 81, alert 40 and alert-button 32. The alert and alert-button counts match research's figures (40 and 32). The rest differ as follows:

- **jsx-text, 155 against 90.** The scanner also counts string literals inside JSX expression children, such as `{"..."}`, `{cond ? "A" : "B"}` and `{x && "..."}`.
- **jsx-prop, 176 against 145.** The contract adds `description` and `emptyText` to the prop list, and the scanner looks through ternaries and fallbacks.
- **status, 151 against 137.** The scanner looks through ternaries, `||`, `??` and concatenation, and it includes App.tsx.
- **object-label, 81 against 95.** This kind only counts the six property names listed in the contract. Research's measurement probably used a wider set.

Research's `Error` bucket (13) is dropped because the contract ignores `new Error(...)`. The totals were not forced to match. Every hit is a real display string, except that a few `label:` values in `useSurveyForm.ts` are field keys such as `strata_count`. The i18n plans will review those.

### Status id leaks (66)

Most of these leaks are `(error as Error).message` interpolations or `${surveyId}` in the sync, profile, draft and survey-operation hooks, plus `useSurveySync.ts`. The only non-template leak is `queued.message` at `useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts:275`.

## ESLint warning table (D-06 / D-07, `npx eslint "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}" App.tsx`)

0 errors and 356 warnings. `npm run lint` exits 0.

| File | jsx-no-literals | restricted text | Pressable role | Pressable label | Total |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| src/components/TypewriterSplash.tsx | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| src/components/cards/DraftCard.tsx | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| src/components/cards/ParcelNearbyCard.tsx | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx | 0 | 24 | 0 | 0 | 24 |
| src/screens/AuthGateScreen.tsx | 16 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 21 |
| src/screens/FactorDetailScreen.tsx | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx | 7 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 15 |
| src/screens/LocalDataOwnerConflictScreen.tsx | 1 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| src/screens/ProfileSetupScreen.tsx | 1 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| src/screens/PublicMapScreen.tsx | 4 | 20 | 5 | 5 | 34 |
| src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx | 1 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 21 |
| src/screens/SurveyDetailScreen.tsx | 55 | 39 | 9 | 9 | 112 |
| src/screens/SurveyFormScreen.components.tsx | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 5 |
| src/screens/SurveyFormScreen.tsx | 21 | 20 | 6 | 6 | 53 |
| src/screens/SurveyListScreen.tsx | 14 | 18 | 0 | 0 | 32 |
| src/screens/SurveyParcelSelectionScreen.tsx | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| src/ui/AppCollapsibleSection.tsx | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| src/ui/IbpScoreBadge.tsx | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| **Total** | **138** | **175** | **21** | **22** | **356** |

"restricted text" covers the `no-restricted-syntax` D-06 selectors: text props and `Alert.alert` literals. `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx` has no lint hits because its titles live in option objects, which only the script's `object-label` kind sees.

Scratch-file checks, with the scratch files deleted afterwards:
- `accessibilityRole="button"` alone is not flagged.
- `<Pressable onPress={f} />` in a `PublicMapScreen*.tsx` file gets both D-07 warnings.
- A `*.test.tsx` under `screens/` gets no warning from the new rules.

## CLI

`node mobile/scripts/structure-report.js <unused-styles|long-files|literals|status-ids> [paths...] [--max N] [--json]`

- Paths are relative to `mobile/`. The default scope is `src` plus `App.tsx`.
- The first output line is `<check>: <count>`.
- Exit codes:
  - 1 only when `--max N` is given and the count is above N;
  - 2 on an unknown check.
- Verified results:
  - `long-files src/app/brand-tokens.ts --max 0` exits 0;
  - `long-files --max 0` exits 1;
  - `bogus` exits 2.

## Tasks

| Task | Commit | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 RED: failing fixture + ratchet tests | 739f411 | mobile/src/__checks__/structure.test.ts |
| 1 GREEN: structure report script and baseline | 83473e8 | mobile/scripts/structure-report.js, mobile/src/__checks__/structure.test.ts |
| 2: ESLint D-06 / D-07 gates at warn | 5e50ab9 | mobile/.eslintrc.json |

## Verification

- `npm run lint` exits 0, with warnings only in mobile.
- `npm run typecheck` exits 0.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` passes 58 suites and 767 tests, and the thresholds hold. The script sits outside the `src/**` coverage glob.
- `structure.test.ts` passes all 10 tests: 9 fixture tests and the ratchet.
- `prettier --check` passes on the three changed files.
- The plan's Task 2 verify command reports 10 D-07 and 24 D-06 warnings on PublicMapScreen.tsx.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 1 - Bug] App.tsx added to the default scan scope.**
   - Scanning `src` only reported 263 unused keys: 2 of the 6 live `app/styles.ts` keys are read only by `mobile/App.tsx`.
   - `DEFAULT_PATHS = ["src", "App.tsx"]` is used by both the CLI and the ratchet, which gives 301.
   - Commit: 83473e8.
2. **[Rule 2] AuthenticatedAppNavigation added to the long-file scope.**
   - `findLongFiles` also covers `src/app/AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx`, because `src/navigation/` does not exist yet and the interfaces count this file (961 lines) in the "10 files" figure.
   - The ESLint override already lists this file by name.
3. **[Rule 2] unused-styles resolves usage over the whole scope.**
   - The per-path mode of `unused-styles` resolves usage over the whole scope before filtering, so a per-folder `--max 0` gate stays correct.
   - An escaping styles binding is treated like dynamic indexing.
4. **Baseline values differ from the plan.**
   - The literal baseline is 635, not research's 552, and the status-leak baseline is 66. Both were measured by the committed scanner, as the plan asked; the reasons are above.
   - The pure functions take absolute or relative file paths. The ratchet test uses the exported `collectFiles`, which is an extra export the plan did not list.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. This is developer tooling only: the script is outside `src/` and does not ship in the bundle.
