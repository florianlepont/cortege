# Phase 01.9 Plan 25: Four tabs, native header search, shared bar hiding Summary

The app now has four tabs (Accueil, Mes Relevés, Explorer, Compte) and one survey stack. On iPhone, search is the native header search bar of Mes Relevés. Both tab trees hide the bar on parcel selection through one rule, `shouldHideTabBar`. The native-or-JS choice returns and logs a reason code, and a Release build always uses the native bar on iPhone.

## What was built

**Task 1: rules (TDD)**
- `tab-bar.ts`:
  - `shouldHideTabBar(name)` is true only for `surveyParcels`.
  - `getFocusedLeafRouteName(state)` follows `routes[index]` down to the leaf. A partial state without an index uses its last route.
- `native-tabs-availability.ts`: `getNativeTabsAvailability(input?)` returns `{ native, reason, envOptOutIgnored }`. The checks run in this order:
  1. Not iOS: `platform`.
  2. `StoreClient` or `appOwnership === "expo"`: `expo-go`.
  3. Opt-out set and `isDev`: `env-opt-out`.
  4. Otherwise: `ok`. If the opt-out was set, `envOptOutIgnored` is true.
- `AppNavigation` decides once per mount:
  - It logs `console.warn("[tabs] native=false reason=<code>")` when it falls back.
  - It logs `console.info("[tabs] native=true reason=ok (EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false ignored in Release)")` when the opt-out was ignored.
  - The lazy `require("@bottom-tabs/react-navigation")` stays in `getNativeTabNavigator()`.

**Task 2: tabs (TDD)**
- The `search` tab is removed from `RootTabParamList`, `IOS_TAB_ICONS`, `ANDROID_TAB_ICONS`, `TAB_TITLES` and `JS_TAB_ICONS`. The `NativeTab.Screen name="search"` and `NativeSearchTab` are deleted.
- `SurveysStackConfig` is reduced to `{ useNativeNav }`. In the stack and the route, `nativeSearchEnabled = useNativeNav && Platform.OS === "ios"`.
- `SurveyListRoute`:
  - `visibleSurveys` is always `state.visibleSurveys`.
  - `showInlineSearch = !nativeSearchEnabled`.
  - `useNativeSearchUI = nativeSearchEnabled`.
  - The `searchBarRef` text sync is kept, and the placeholder comes from the catalogue.
- Hiding the tab bar:
  - Native tree: `AppNavigation` passes `onStateChange` to `NavigationContainer` only in native mode. It stores `shouldHideTabBar(getFocusedLeafRouteName(state))` as boolean state, and `NativeRootTabs` forwards it as `tabBarHidden` (confirmed in `react-native-bottom-tabs` `TabView.d.ts:209` and `TabViewImpl.swift`).
  - JS tree: `tabBarStyle: shouldHideTabBar(getFocusedRouteNameFromRoute(route)) ? { display: "none" } : JS_TAB_BAR_STYLE`.
- Catalogue (`fr.navigation`): tab titles, headers (Mes Relevés, Détail, Nouveau relevé, Modifier le relevé, `Facteur X`, Parcelles, Compte, Paramètres), the search placeholder, and an accessibility label for the settings header button.
- `SurveyListScreen`: `showHero = !useNativeSearchUI` still controls the custom hero. A new `showFeatured = showHero || query empty` controls the create card, the "À faire" card, the de-duplication and the section title ("Mes relevés" or "Résultats").

## Investigation: why the Release build showed the JS bar (STATE todo, D-08)

Findings from `git log -S EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS`, the `fb22c7b` / #119 commit message, `mobile/.env.example`, `README-native.md` and `app.json`:

1. **Most likely cause of the JS bar in Release:**
   - While debugging #119 (blank tabs after SDK 57), the owner forced the JS tabs by setting `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false`, which the commit message calls "the project's own escape hatch".
   - This variable is not in `.env.example`, so it was set in the local, gitignored `mobile/.env`.
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined into the JS bundle when it is built, so every later build from that checkout, Release included, took the `false` branch of the old `isNativeBottomTabViewAvailable()`.
   - The old warning ("RNCTabView unavailable … Expo Go or native binary not built yet") pointed to the wrong cause.
   - The same leftover explains the non-glass bar in the dev build.
   - Nothing in `app.json` or the plugin list opts out. `react-native-bottom-tabs` is registered.
2. **Most likely cause of "Mes relevés ne marche pas":**
   - In the native tree, the dedicated Recherche tab mounted a second copy of the surveys stack.
   - Both stacks shared the same survey selection and `beforeRemove → closeSurveyDetailSelection`, so leaving a detail in one stack cleared the selection shown in the other.
   - The native Mes Relevés tab also showed an unfiltered list with no search.
   - This is plausible, but it was not reproduced here. Under the JS fallback, Mes Relevés used the inline-search layout, and the only native-specific change was the header setup. The owner confirms on the device (D-11).
3. **How this plan removes both causes:**
   - A Release build now ignores the opt-out and logs `console.info` that it did so.
   - A dev build that falls back logs `[tabs] native=false reason=env-opt-out`, so the cause is visible in Metro.
   - There is one survey stack, so no second stack competes for the selection.

## Fallback reason codes

| Code | When | Tree |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | iOS native build (dev without opt-out, or any Release) | native |
| `platform` | Android | JS |
| `expo-go` | `executionEnvironment === StoreClient` or `appOwnership === "expo"` | JS |
| `env-opt-out` | `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false` **and** `__DEV__` | JS |

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: **77 suites, 1,013 tests pass**, exit 0, and every threshold holds. `src/navigation` (root, stacks, tabs) is at 100/100/100/100, and `routes` is at 100/95.23/100/100 against its 96-branch row (the row is `./src/navigation/`, so the aggregate holds).
- Navigation and render-count run: 7 suites, 69 tests pass. The render-count harness passes with `EXPECTED` unchanged.
- New tests:
  - `tab-bar.test.ts`: 11 tests.
  - `native-tabs-availability.test.ts`: 8 tests, one per branch, including Release ignoring the opt-out and Expo Go winning over the opt-out.
  - `tabs.test.tsx`: 5 tests. Both trees register exactly `["home","surveys","publicMap","account"]`. Native `tabBarHidden` goes false, then true on `surveyParcels`, then false. Navigation that keeps the bar does not re-render the native navigator. The JS tree uses `display: none` or `JS_TAB_BAR_STYLE`.
  - `navigation.test.tsx`: +1 test for the one-time Release `console.info`.
  - `survey-list-500.test.tsx`: +2 tests for the native header mode (cards kept without a query, results only with a query).
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (62 warnings, none in `src/navigation`). `npx eslint src/navigation --max-warnings 0`: clean.
- `npm run typecheck`: passes. `npm run format:check`: passes.
- `structure-report literals src/navigation --max 0`: 0 (11 before). `long-files src/navigation --max 0`: 0.
- `grep '"search"\|search:' mobile/src/navigation/types.ts`: empty.
- `npx expo export`: iOS bundles 1,467 modules, and Android also bundles.
- T-01.9-44: `require("@bottom-tabs/react-navigation")` still appears exactly once in `NativeRootTabs.tsx`, and nothing in `src` imports `@bottom-tabs` statically.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 2] `envOptOutIgnored` added to the availability result**
- The plan's return type is `{ native, reason }`.
- `AppNavigation` must log when a Release build ignored the opt-out, so the result also carries `envOptOutIgnored`. `reason` is still `ok` in that case.

**2. [Rule 1] JS surveys tab bar style**
- The old option returned `tabBarStyle: undefined` when the bar was shown. That overrides the navigator's `screenOptions` style, so the JS bar lost its style while Mes Relevés was focused.
- It now returns the exported `JS_TAB_BAR_STYLE`, as the plan's interface asked ("<normal style>").

**3. [Rule 2] Keep the create and to-do cards under the native header**
- Reusing the old search-tab layout (`useNativeSearchUI` true) as-is would have removed the create card and the "À faire" card from Mes Relevés on iPhone.
- The only change is inside the uses of `useNativeSearchUI`: a derived `showFeatured`. No other prop changed.

**4. Extra files beyond the plan list**
- `routes/SurveyFormRoute.tsx`: its "New survey" / "Edit survey" titles were the remaining literals for the `src/navigation` literal gate.
- `stacks/surveys-stack-config.ts`: dropped `searchEntry`.
- `navigation.test.tsx`, `routes/routes.test.tsx` and `survey-list-500.test.tsx`: tests updated or added.
- `HomeStack.tsx` and `PublicMapStack.tsx` were in the plan list but have no text or tab logic, so they are unchanged.

**5. [Rule 2] Accessibility label for the account settings header button** (`fr.navigation.a11y.openSettings`).

**6. [Environment]** `node_modules` symlinks to the main checkout were used for the checks. They were never staged and are removed at the end.

## Owner checks on the iPhone (01.9-31, D-11)

1. Remove any `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false` line from `mobile/.env`. A Release build now ignores it, but a dev build honours it and logs `[tabs] native=false reason=env-opt-out`.
2. Release build (`npx expo run:ios --device --configuration Release`):
   - The liquid-glass native bar shows **4 tabs** and no Recherche tab.
   - If it falls back anyway, the device log shows `[tabs] native=false reason=<code>`.
3. Mes Relevés:
   - The header shows the title and a visible search field (`placement: "automatic"`).
   - Typing filters the list and hides the create and "À faire" cards.
   - Cancel restores them.
   - Opening a survey and going back works.
   - If the field is not visible on iOS 26, try `"integratedButton"` (a one-line change in `SurveyListRoute.tsx`).
4. Parcel selection (from the form wizard or a survey detail):
   - The native bar hides and comes back when you leave.
   - Switching tabs away from the parcel screen shows the bar again.
5. Android or Expo Go: 4 JS tabs, the inline search in Mes Relevés, and the bar hidden on parcel selection.

## Threat model

- **T-01.9-46 (mitigated):** Release ignores the env opt-out, as tested in `native-tabs-availability.test.ts` and `navigation.test.tsx`.
- **T-01.9-47 (mitigated):** the reason code is logged once at startup and tested per branch.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Commits

- bc0a82c test(01.9-25): add failing tests for the tab-bar rule and native-tabs availability
- 059aea4 feat(01.9-25): shared tab-bar rule and native-tabs availability with reason codes
- 7e43e6c test(01.9-25): add failing tests for the four tabs and the shared bar hiding
- 77ed13f feat(01.9-25): four tabs with native header search and shared bar hiding

## TDD Gate Compliance

Both tasks have a `test(...)` commit (RED, suites failing on the missing modules and exports) followed by a `feat(...)` commit (GREEN).

## Self-Check: PASSED

- The five created files exist.
- Commits bc0a82c, 059aea4, 7e43e6c and 77ed13f are in `git log`.
