# Phase 01.9 Plan 30: CLAUDE.md facts for phase 01.9 Summary

CLAUDE.md now describes the five `src/state` contexts filled by `AppStateProvider` (the one `useSurveySync` call), the memoised route components in `src/navigation/routes`, the global `ReactNavigation.RootParamList` typing, the 4 tabs with Mes Relevés header search, the D-08 native iOS tab-bar rule, the typed French catalogue with `StatusMessage`, the SMTP removal, the root without `App.tsx` or runtime dependencies, and the `native-android` / `native-ios` CI jobs.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| 1 | Architecture, key files and tabs | a3cdb88 | CLAUDE.md |
| 2 | Environment, CI and repository layout | c6af498 | CLAUDE.md |

## What changed in CLAUDE.md

- **Overview:** a line under the packages table says the root `package.json` holds only workspaces, `overrides` and a dev dependency; no root `App.tsx`, `tsconfig.json` or runtime dependencies.
- **Tech stack:** Mobile navigation row names `react-native-bottom-tabs` for the native iOS bar.
- **Architecture → Mobile:** "custom hooks only, no Redux or Context API" replaced by the five contexts (session + `useAccessToken`, status, sync actions, surveys + `useSurveyActions`, survey form `useSurveyFormState`), the narrow nearby-parcels context, the single-assembler rule and stable actions. New **Navigation** block (AppNavigation, stacks/tabs, global param list, `component={XRoute}` routes, 4 tabs, header search, D-08 rule including the dev-only `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_TABS=false` opt-out, `shouldHideTabBar`). New **Text and i18n** block (`fr` catalogue, `StatusMessage`, `logStatusDetail`).
- **Key files:** wrong `mobile/src/App.tsx` row corrected to `mobile/App.tsx` (AppStateProvider, navigation, overlays); added `AppStateProvider.tsx`, `AppNavigation.tsx`, `i18n/fr/index.ts`. `app/styles.ts` and `AuthenticatedAppNavigation` were not listed.
- **Environment variables:** SMTP row removed, with a note that the API sends no email and `check-env.sh` flags leftover `SMTP_*` lines.
- **CI/CD:** items 7 (native builds, path filter, `workflow_dispatch`) and 8 (`CI OK` gate) added.

Left for 01.9-32 (D-12): versions, `/v1/sync`, `local_meta`, test conventions, API module table, IBP domain, and other CI jobs not introduced by this phase (audit, mobile-build, image-check).

## Verification

- Plan greps: "no Redux or Context API" absent; `src/state`, `src/i18n`, `src/navigation`, `AppStateProvider` present; `SMTP_ENABLED` absent; `native-ios`/`native-android` present.
- `npm run format:check` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors (62 pre-existing warnings), `npm run typecheck` passes, `npm run test:unit` 29 + 77 suites green (638 + 1013 tests).

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. (Correcting the stale `mobile/src/App.tsx` path to `mobile/App.tsx` was part of the planned Key files update.)

## Self-Check: PASSED

- CLAUDE.md modified; commits a3cdb88 and c6af498 exist.
