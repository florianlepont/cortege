# Phase 01.9 Plan 10: SMTP and EmailService removal Summary

The unused `EmailService` and every SMTP setting (`SMTP_*`, `EMAIL_CHANGE_CONFIRM_URL_TEMPLATE`) are gone from the API code, config schema, `AppConfig`, the four env examples, the CI env and the READMEs. The VPS pre-flight check `infra/vps/check-env.sh` now reports any leftover SMTP line as `INFO : <VAR> : ligne inutile, peut être supprimée.` and still exits 0. It never prints the values.

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commits | Files |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 1 | Delete EmailService and the SMTP configuration | 69a1a51 (RED), 3f53fc1 (GREEN) | email.service.ts (deleted), env.schema.ts, config.types.ts, app-config.ts, env.schema.spec.ts, setup-env.js |
| 2 | check-env obsolete lines, examples, CI env and READMEs | f0420ac (RED), 9f2a774 (GREEN) | check-env.sh, check-env-parity.spec.ts, 4 env examples, 3 READMEs, ci.yml |

## Tests added

- `env.schema.spec.ts`: `loadAppConfig({})` has no `smtp` key. A valid production env with leftover `SMTP_ENABLED/HOST/PORT/PASSWORD` and `EMAIL_CHANGE_CONFIRM_URL_TEMPLATE` passes both `validateEnv` and `findProductionProblems` (T-01.9-20). The old SMTP parsing cases were removed.
- `check-env-parity.spec.ts`: new case where `SMTP_PASSWORD=<unique secret>` gives exit 0, INFO lines for SMTP_PASSWORD, SMTP_ENABLED and EMAIL_CHANGE_CONFIRM_URL_TEMPLATE, no `ERREUR`, and no secret in the output (T-01.9-21). There is also a new parity fixture "leftover SMTP lines are harmless", and `SMTP_SECRET` was added to the no-echo list that every fixture checks. The case "env.example with only its CHANGE_ME placeholders replaced passes both checks" still passes.

## Verification

- API unit + coverage: 29 suites, 638 tests passed.
- Mobile unit: 68 suites, 895 tests passed. `test:coverage:mobile` exit 0 (thresholds met).
- Full API E2E on `ibp_p19_10_test` (ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET unset, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`): 25 suites, 177 passed, 3 skipped.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (66 existing warnings). `npm run typecheck` OK. `npm run format:check` OK. `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml` OK. `npm --workspace api run build` OK, and `api/dist/users/email.service.js` is no longer produced.
- `grep -c "phase 01.9 (D-09)" infra/vps/check-env.sh` = 1.
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` appears only in `check-env.sh` DEAD_VARIABLES, its parity fixture and `docs/audits`, so the check passes with no change.
- `nodemailer` appears only in `api/package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Plan 01.9-19 removes it from both.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 3 - Blocking] Local `npm ci` in the worktree.** The worktree had no `node_modules` and was resolving to the main checkout's stale tree (`lru-cache@5`), so `api` build failed on unrelated files. I ran `npm ci`. It installs from the lockfile and leaves `package-lock.json` unchanged. It was not committed.
2. **[Plan inconsistency] W3 `git grep "SMTP_"` gate has one expected hit.** The gate returns only `api/test/env.schema.spec.ts`. That file holds the behavior test the plan itself requires (T-01.9-20: a production env with leftover SMTP keys still starts). The gate's exclusion list omits this file. No product code, example, CI or doc file matches.
3. **Wording in infra/vps/README.md.** The sentence says "lignes SMTP" rather than `SMTP_*` so the README stays out of the same grep gate.
4. **Local PostgreSQL started** (`pg_ctlcluster 16 main start`) for the E2E run.

CLAUDE.md's SMTP env row is left for 01.9-30, as planned.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- api/src/users/email.service.ts absent. Commits 69a1a51, 3f53fc1, f0420ac and 9f2a774 exist on the branch.
