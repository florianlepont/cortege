# Phase 01.9 Plan 27: Survey list split and catalogue Summary

The survey list screen went from 1,642 lines to 377. It now composes parts in `mobile/src/screens/survey-list/`, each part keeps its styles next to it, and every text reads from `fr.surveyList`. The FlatList settings, `SurveyRow`, the 500-survey test and the render-count harness are unchanged, and they all pass.

## What was built

**Task 1: split (commit 5acf989)**

| File | Lines | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `SurveyListScreen.tsx` | 377 | Derived data, memoised header, leading items, rows and footer, the `Animated.FlatList` |
| `survey-list/ListHero.tsx` | 347 | `useHeroGeometry` (measured expanded height, collapsed height, top inset) and the collapsing hero |
| `survey-list/StatTile.tsx` | 84 | Severity stat tile |
| `survey-list/FilterBar.tsx` | ~200 | Sticky bar: summary, advanced toggle, inline search |
| `survey-list/FilterPanel.tsx` | ~190 | `FilterSection`, status chips, advanced panel |
| `survey-list/AttentionSection.tsx` | ~200 | "À faire" card and `pickContinueDraft` / `pickAttentionSurveys` |
| `survey-list/ContinueDraftCard.tsx` | ~100 | Draft row with progress bar |
| `survey-list/CreateSurveyCard.tsx` | ~125 | Create call to action |
| `survey-list/ListEmptyState.tsx` | ~70 | The two empty states |
| `survey-list/leading-items.tsx` | ~100 | `LeadingListItem`, `keyExtractor`, `useLeadingItems` |
| `survey-list/types.ts`, `styles.ts` | small | Screen props type; screen-level and shared style keys |

- The screen's entry path, name and props are unchanged.
- Unused styles: 0, both before (01.9-22 had already reached 0) and after the move. Every key moved with the part that reads it.

**Task 2: catalogue (commits 5453b62 RED, 18789aa GREEN)**
- `fr.surveyList` gained these sections: `hero`, `stats`, `summary`, `filters` (title, toggle, search, sections, date placeholder, reset, and `options` by value), `createCard`, `attention`, `continueDraft`, `section` and `empty`.
- Plurals use a local `plural()` helper, the same as `fr/home.ts`. The output is the same French text as before, for example "2 filtres actifs" and "+2 autres relevés à examiner".
- `filter-options.ts` builds each array with `withLabels(values, options.<group>)`. The values and their order are written in code.
- `filter-options.test.ts` has 6 tests. For each group it checks the exact values and their order (T-01.9-48), that each label equals the catalogue entry, and that the label keys match the values exactly.

## Verification

- `structure-report long-files | unused-styles | literals src/screens/SurveyListScreen.tsx src/screens/survey-list --max 0`: 0 / 0 / 0. Literals were at 65 before.
- `npx eslint src/screens/SurveyListScreen.tsx src/screens/survey-list --max-warnings 0`: clean.
- `survey-list-500.test.tsx` and `render-counts.test.tsx` pass, and `git diff` shows no change to either file or to `SurveyRow.tsx`.
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: **78 suites, 1,019 tests pass**, and every threshold holds.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors (34 warnings, none in the survey list). `npm run typecheck`: passes. `npm run format:check`: passes.

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Rule 3] Extra parts inside `screens/survey-list/`**
- Moving only the listed parts left the screen at 485 lines. To get under 400, four more files were added: `CreateSurveyCard.tsx`, `ListEmptyState.tsx`, `leading-items.tsx` and `types.ts`.
- The plan's layout decision allows this: part names inside the folder can change.

**2. `filter-options.ts` created in Task 1**
- `FilterPanel` imports it, so Task 1 moved the arrays there unchanged, with their literal labels.
- Task 2 then wrote the failing test first and switched the arrays to catalogue labels. RED and GREEN are separate commits.

**3. Advanced-filters open state lives in `FilterBar`**
- This moved from the screen to `FilterBar`, and it changes no behaviour in normal use.
- One edge case: if the filters bar unmounts (the native header and the inline search both off, which no current route does), the panel reopens closed.

**4. `visibleAttentionSurveys` memo removed**
- `AttentionSection` now takes `slice(0, 2)` itself, and its memoised element depends on the memoised `attentionSurveys`. The dependencies are the same or more stable.

**5. [Environment]** `node_modules` symlinks to the main checkout were used for the checks. They were never staged and are removed at the end.

## Owner checks on device (01.9-31)

These are visual only, because the layout code was moved without changes:
- Mes Relevés (JS fallback / Android): the hero collapses on scroll, and the filters bar sticks under the collapsed hero.
- The stat tiles filter the list.
- "Plus" opens the advanced panel.
- The create card, the "À faire" card and the "Continuer le brouillon" row open the right screens.
- Both empty states show the marten illustration or the funnel.

## Threat model

- **T-01.9-48 (mitigated):** `filter-options.test.ts` asserts the values and their order for all five groups.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Commits

- 5acf989 refactor(01.9-27): split the survey list screen into parts under 400 lines
- 5453b62 test(01.9-27): add failing test for catalogue filter option labels
- 18789aa feat(01.9-27): survey list text and filter labels from the French catalogue

## TDD Gate Compliance

Task 2 has a `test(...)` commit that fails, because `fr.surveyList.filters` does not exist yet. The `feat(...)` commit that follows makes it pass.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All created files exist.
- Commits 5acf989, 5453b62 and 18789aa are in `git log`.
