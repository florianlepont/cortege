# Phase 01.9 Plan 06: Native CI builds and audit status Summary

Unsigned native Android (`gradle assembleRelease`) and iOS simulator (`xcodebuild` Release, `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`) build jobs in CI, gated by a `native` path filter and `workflow_dispatch`, wired into CI OK; plus an audit "8. Statut" table tracing 63 findings rows to PRs #125–#156 and 15 pending rows (01.8/01.9).

## Status

**All three tasks are complete.** Both native jobs and CI OK concluded success on run [36239341355](https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36239341355) (head `14be3a1`), which is the baseline for plan 01.9-19. The first Android run had failed on corrupt tab icons; that was fixed outside this plan (see Deviations).

## Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Native build jobs in ci.yml and README-native | 5da2b68 | .github/workflows/ci.yml, mobile/README-native.md |
| 2 | Audit status section for phases 01.2 to 01.7 | 898ba04 | docs/audits/audit-2026-09-code-complet.md |
| 3 | Record the native jobs' first green run (orchestrator evidence) | see final docs commit | this SUMMARY (ci.yml unchanged: the failure was in the assets, not the job) |

## Task 1: CI jobs

- `on:` gains `workflow_dispatch:`.
- `changes` gains output `native`, filter `mobile/**`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **Native build — Android** (`native-android`): ubuntu-latest, timeout 60 min, `if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || needs.changes.outputs.native == 'true'`. Steps: checkout, setup-node 22, node_modules cache (same key as the other Linux jobs), `npm ci` on a miss, `actions/setup-java@de7274f081f381c8f8158605e0321c36c376e2e6 # v6.0.1` (temurin 17), Gradle cache keyed on the lockfile, `npx expo prebuild -p android --no-install --clean`, `./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon`.
- **Native build — iOS** (`native-ios`): macos-26, timeout 90 min, same `if:`. Steps: checkout, setup-node 22, node_modules cache keyed with `runner.os` and `runner.arch`, `npm ci` on a miss, `xcodebuild -version`, `npx expo prebuild -p ios --clean` (runs pod install), then `xcodebuild -workspace ios/<Name>.xcworkspace -scheme <Name> -configuration Release -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build`, with `<Name>` derived from `ls -d ios/*.xcworkspace`.
- Both jobs set dummy `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`. No secret, no signing; workflow permissions stay `contents: read`.
- `ci-ok`: both jobs in `needs`, `NATIVE_ANDROID_RESULT` / `NATIVE_IOS_RESULT` env and echo lines, both in the success-or-skipped loop.
- `mobile/README-native.md`: new "Native builds in CI" section (what each job builds, no signing or secret, path filter, manual start via Actions → CI → Run workflow, device check still needed for the tab bar after login).

Local validation:
- `python3 yaml.safe_load` parses; jobs list includes `native-android`, `native-ios`; `ci-ok.needs` includes both.
- `/tmp/actionlint-bin/actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`: no error.
- `npx prettier --check .github/workflows/ci.yml` and `npm run format:check`: clean.
- `cd mobile && EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://ci.invalid/v1 npx expo prebuild -p android --no-install --clean`: "Finished prebuild". The generated `android/app/build.gradle` has `release { signingConfig signingConfigs.debug }` (A3 holds, so `assembleRelease` is kept). Gradle wrapper 9.3.1, RN gradle plugin `jvmToolchain(17)`. The generated `mobile/android` was deleted; `git status --porcelain mobile/android mobile/ios` is empty (`.gitignore` already ignores both).
- iOS cannot be checked on Linux; the macos-26 runner image lists Xcode 26.6 as default, above RN 0.86's minimum (16.1).

## Task 2: audit Statut

`## 8. Statut` appended to `docs/audits/audit-2026-09-code-complet.md` (French intro + table `| Réf. | Constat (court) | Phase | PR |`).

Method: every first-parent merge of HEAD from #125 to #157 was mapped to the `01.x-NN` plan ids of its non-docs commits (`git log --format=%s M^1..M^2`); commits of 01.2-01/01.2-02 were located with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`. Findings were joined to phases with the remediation plan's §6 traceability matrix and the ROADMAP "Source" lines.

Implementation PRs per phase: 01.2 → #125, #126, #127, #128, #129 (review fixes CR-01, WR-01..08); 01.3 → #134; 01.4 → #145; 01.5 → #150; 01.6 → #154; 01.7 → #156. The other PRs in the range are docs-only (verification/closing) and are named in the intro but not repeated per row.

Counts:
- 78 table rows. All 34 anchored findings (ARCH-1..8, A-C1, A-H1..4, A-M1..9, M-C1, M-H1..5, CI-1..6), T1..T6 and the unnamed §3.1/§3.2/§4/§6 findings of the matrix appear. Findings split across phases get one row per part (ARCH-3, ARCH-7, A-M2, T2, T3, T5).
- 63 rows linked to PRs #125–#156: 01.2: 10, 01.3: 11, 01.4: 7, 01.5: 14, 01.6: 6, 01.7: 13, plus ARCH-2 (01.6 + 01.7) and T2 (01.2 + 01.3 + 01.5).
- 15 rows "en attente" (01.8: ARCH-1, T2 RS256, T5 split, T6; 01.9: ARCH-4, ARCH-7 remainder, ARCH-8, `useNavigation() as any`, FR/EN texts, accessibility, re-renders, FlatList, `listLocalSurveys`, map, T3 React spies). Plan 01.9-32 completes them.
- 0 rows "à vérifier".

## CI evidence (Task 3)

Supplied by the orchestrator. The branch `claude/code-audit-complete-3sn99m` was pushed after wave 1 was merged.

- Run: https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36239341355 (head `14be3a1`, wave 1 plus the tab-icon fix `5a92101`)

| Job | Conclusion | Build step (UTC) | Job link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native build — Android | success | `gradle assembleRelease` 11:38:15 → 11:56:50 (18 min 35 s) | [108397040524](https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36239341355/job/108397040524) |
| Native build — iOS | success | `xcodebuild` Release, simulator, unsigned: 11:39:37 → 11:49:22 (9 min 45 s) | [108397040443](https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36239341355/job/108397040443) |
| CI OK | success | — | — |

Log lines quoted from the jobs:

- Android: `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 18m 33s` and `584 actionable tasks: 584 executed` (cold Gradle cache)
- iOS: `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`

Earlier runs:
- iOS had already passed on `f50a141`: run [36234069198](https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36234069198), job 108382792139.
- Android failed in that run (job 108382792143); see Deviation 4.

This run is on the tree before the hygiene changes, so it is the baseline plan 01.9-19 compares against after it removes dependencies.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 1 - Bug] 01.2 PR range.** CONTEXT/RESEARCH said 01.2 = #127–#130. Git shows plans 01.2-01 (A-C1) and 01.2-02 (A-H1, A-M6, report reason bound) merged in #125 and #126. The table links those PRs instead of guessing a PR in #127–#130; #129 is also linked for the 01.2 review fixes.
2. **iOS runner pinned to `macos-26`** instead of `macos-latest` (allowed by the plan's A2 note): same image today, but it avoids an unannounced Xcode change when the label moves.
3. **Gradle cache via actions/cache** (existing pinned SHA) rather than setup-java `cache: gradle`, which would fail before prebuild creates the Gradle files.
4. **[Rule 1 - Bug, found by the new job] Corrupt tab icon PNGs broke the Android release build.**
   - **Found during:** Task 3, first CI run [36234069198](https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36234069198), job 108382792143.
   - **Issue:** `:app:mergeReleaseResources` failed because AAPT2 crashed on `mobile/assets/tabs/{account,public-map,surveys}.png`. The files were 1x1 placeholders with a truncated IDAT chunk (bad CRC, no IEND). They were already corrupt before `57a2aee`. Metro accepts them, so neither `expo export` nor the tests ever caught it.
   - **Fix:** `5a92101` "fix(mobile): replace corrupt tab icon placeholders with valid PNGs". The files are now valid 1x1 transparent PNGs, re-stamped with `scripts/stamp-asset-copyright.py`. The owner approved the fix. It was committed outside this plan's files; `ci.yml` needed no change.
   - **Result:** Android is green on run 36239341355. The new job did its job: it caught a native-only breakage that no other check sees.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. The only new third-party action is `actions/setup-java`, pinned by full SHA (T-01.9-08); no secret or signing material is used (T-01.9-09).

## Self-Check: PASSED

- Files exist: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `mobile/README-native.md`, `docs/audits/audit-2026-09-code-complet.md`, this SUMMARY.
- Commits exist: 5da2b68, 898ba04, eddf7ae; fix 5a92101 is on the branch.
- The Task 3 check passes: the SUMMARY contains an `actions/runs/<id>` URL and `BUILD SUCCEEDED`.
