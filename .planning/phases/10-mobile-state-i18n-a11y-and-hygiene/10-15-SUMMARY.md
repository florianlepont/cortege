# Phase 01.9 Plan 15: Account screen split, catalogue and narrow token Summary

The 596-line account screen is now a 151-line container plus three parts under `mobile/src/screens/account/`. All its text, including the three Alert dialogs, comes from `fr.account` or `fr.common`, and `IdentityCard` is the only part that receives `accessToken`, which it uses for the Bearer header on the profile picture.

## What was built

- **AccountScreen.tsx** (151 lines): same path, export name and props. It holds the first/last/display name state, the dirty check, the hero name and the scroll layout, and composes the parts.
- **IdentityCard.tsx** (175): hero card, avatar with Bearer header, initials fallback, camera badge (role button, catalogue label and hint), the iOS action sheet and its Android Alert fallback. It exports `resolveInitials` and `resolveProfilePictureUri`.
- **ProfileCard.tsx** (131): profile header with saved/unsaved chip, the three name fields with focus chaining, a children slot for the settings rows, and the save button.
- **AccountSettingsRows.tsx** (126): e-mail row and inline editor (its own state), the password row with its confirmation Alert, and `LogoutButton` with its confirmation Alert.
- **styles.ts** (148): `accountStyles`, `identityStyles`, `profileStyles`. The original 25 keys were all in use; the scanner confirms 0 unused keys after the split.
- **fr/account.ts**: every text of the screen, with `alerts.photo`, `alerts.passwordReset` (message is a function of the e-mail), `alerts.logout` and `a11y`.

## Gates (paths `src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx src/screens/account`)

| Gate | Result |
|------|--------|
| `structure-report.js long-files --max 0` | 0 |
| `structure-report.js unused-styles --max 0` | 0 |
| `structure-report.js literals --max 0` | 0 |
| `npx eslint … --max-warnings 0` | 0 warnings (was 24 for AccountScreen.tsx) |
| `grep -l accessToken screens/account/*.tsx` | IdentityCard.tsx only |

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`: 63 suites, 820 tests pass; thresholds hold.
- `IdentityCard.test.tsx`: 9 tests (Bearer header, no header without token, initials/e-mail/default role, badge role and labels, iOS action sheet options and actions, Android Alert with and without removal, two helper tests). With the catalogue suite: 18 tests.
- `npm run lint` exits 0 (332 warnings repo-wide, down from 356; none in the account paths).
- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` exit 0.

## Tasks

| Task | Commit | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1: split the account screen | 611853f | AccountScreen.tsx, account/{IdentityCard,ProfileCard,AccountSettingsRows}.tsx, account/styles.ts |
| 2 RED: failing identity card test | 7bb3da0 | account/IdentityCard.test.tsx |
| 2 GREEN: catalogue and a11y | cbc765d | fr/account.ts, AccountScreen.tsx, account/*.tsx |

## Deviations from Plan

None in behaviour. Notes:

- No unused style keys existed in this screen (the 01.9-04 baseline lists none for AccountScreen.tsx), so Task 1 deleted none; the styles were only regrouped per part.
- The only Pressable (camera badge) already had a role and label; they now come from the catalogue. The other controls are `AppButton` / `AppSettingsRow`, which carry their own a11y.
- The test mocks `react-native`, `AppCard` and `AppStatusChip` locally (the AuthGateScreen recipe); the screen uses the React Native `Image`, not expo-image, so the expo-image mock is not involved.

## TDD Gate Compliance

RED 7bb3da0 (test fails to compile: `fr.account.a11y` and `fr.account.alerts` missing), GREEN cbc765d.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. T-01.9-28 is mitigated: `accessToken` reaches only `IdentityCard` in `screens/account/`.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: all 7 files listed in key-files
- FOUND: commits 611853f, 7bb3da0, cbc765d
