  - "parcel_ids comparison falls back to [existing.parcel_id] when existingParcelIds is empty, per the plan's interface spec, so legacy single-parcel surveys are compared correctly"
  - "The submitted-survey accepted-resync path runs a narrower UPDATE (visibility/sync_version/updated_at only) rather than reusing the general UPDATE with COALESCE, guaranteeing factors/factor_results/scores/parcel columns are never touched even if the general UPDATE's parameter list changed later"

# Phase 01.4 Plan 05: Upsert read-only hardening and installed-app backward compatibility Summary

**`upsertForUser` can no longer submit a survey or move `expires_at`, a submitted survey's observation fields are protected by value (409 `survey_submitted_read_only`), and a new E2E replaying today's exact mobile payload shapes proves installed apps keep syncing unchanged.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min of task commits (21:39:46Z → 21:51:51Z), plus prior reading/setup
- **Tasks:** 3 completed (1 TDD, 2 auto)
- **Files modified:** 7 (2 created, 5 modified)

## Accomplishments

- Added `getChangedSubmittedReadOnlyFields(body, existing, existingParcelIds)` to `surveys-normalize.utils.ts`: a pure value-comparison helper covering `site_name`, `parcel_id`/`parcel_ids`, `observation_year`, `version_number`, `previous_survey_id`, `region_version`, `vegetation_stage` and `factors` — normalized the same way as their individual `normalize*` helpers, with a local `jsonDeepEqual` for `factors` (key-order independent, arrays ordered). `scores` is excluded (D-13). `getSubmittedReadOnlyFields` (used by `patchSurvey`'s 422 contract) is untouched. 15 unit cases cover every behavior bullet in the plan.
- `upsertForUser` never reads `body.status` or `body.expires_at` again (verified by a `node` AST-slice check per the plan's own acceptance criterion): the INSERT always writes `status = 'draft'` and a server-computed `expires_at` (`created_at` + 7 days); the UPDATE for draft/expired surveys no longer sets either column (D-03).
- When the existing survey is `submitted`, `upsertForUser` now computes `getChangedSubmittedReadOnlyFields` right after the `sync_version` guard: a non-empty result throws `ConflictException({ code: "survey_submitted_read_only", details: { survey_id, fields } })` (409 via `mapSyncError`); an empty result runs a restricted `UPDATE ... SET visibility, sync_version, updated_at` and skips `ensureParcelIds`/`syncSurveyParcels` entirely, so factors/factor_results/scores/parcels are provably never rewritten on an accepted resync (D-04).
- Fixed the two existing E2E fixtures that depended on client-controlled status/expires_at: `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts`'s "submit expired" test now sets `expires_at` directly via SQL after the upsert; `epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts`'s four `status: "submitted"` payloads were replaced with a direct `UPDATE surveys SET status = 'submitted', submitted_at = NOW()` after creation. Grepped all of `api/test` for other status/expires_at dependencies — the only other occurrences are in `ibp-rules.spec.ts` (direct unit tests of `IbpRulesService.validateSubmit`, unrelated to upsert) and `surveys-sync.service.spec.ts` (asserts the DTO still accepts/passes these fields through, which is correct and unchanged).
- New `api/test/sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts` replays, field-for-field, the exact operation envelopes `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts` builds and the local-save payload shape from `mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts`/`buildSurveyPayloadFromRemote`: a fresh-install batch (`survey.upsert` + `attachment.create` + `visibility_update` + a second survey's `upsert`+`delete`, all `synced`), an `attachment.delete`, a resync attempting `status: "submitted"` (accepted but ignored — status stays `draft`, no `submitted` event), a real submit via `POST /surveys/:id/submit`, then a pulled-survey replay sequence (same sync_version, bumped sync_version with identical values, `scores: {}`, and a changed `factors.A`) proving the read-only protection end to end (409 `survey_submitted_read_only`, `details.fields` contains `"factors"`, stored factors untouched), and finally an `expires_at: "abc"` draft upsert that is still accepted.
- `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md` updated: `POST /surveys` and `POST /sync` document that `status`/`expires_at` are accepted-but-ignored and the value-based read-only 409; `POST /surveys/{id}/submit` documents the concurrent-submit 409; the standard error code list gains `survey_submitted_read_only` and `survey_id_conflict` (`parcel_version_conflict` already listed, annotated further).

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Value comparison of submitted read-only fields** - `ba13afb` (test), `e40f0ba` (feat)
2. **Task 2: upsertForUser ignores client status/expires_at and protects submitted surveys; fix dependent fixtures** - `4ef92fa` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Installed-app replay E2E and contract docs** - `fd0f155` (test + docs)

_Plan-metadata commit follows this SUMMARY per the execution protocol._

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts` - `getChangedSubmittedReadOnlyFields`, local `jsonDeepEqual`/`parcelIdSetEqual` helpers
- `api/test/surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts` - new unit spec, 15 cases
- `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts` - `upsertForUser`: server-only `expires_at`/`status`, submitted-survey read-only branch (restricted UPDATE + `survey_submitted_read_only` 409), draft/expired UPDATE no longer touches status/expires_at
- `api/test/surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` - "submit expired" fixture sets `expires_at` via SQL instead of relying on the client value
- `api/test/epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` - four fixtures set `status = 'submitted'` via SQL after creation instead of sending it in the upsert payload
- `api/test/sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts` - new E2E spec, installed-app payload replay
- `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md` - contract updates for D-03/D-04/D-13 and new error codes

## Decisions Made

See `key-decisions` in frontmatter. No decisions outside Claude's discretion per `05-CONTEXT.md`.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All `must_haves` truths and artifacts from the plan frontmatter are implemented and verified by the unit spec, the fixed E2E fixtures, the new installed-app-compat E2E, and the plan's own node/grep acceptance-criteria checks.

## Issues Encountered

- Worktree required `git reset --hard` to fast-forward from `dad66f1` (an ancestor of the expected wave-2 base) to `951944b6` before any edits, per the `worktree_branch_check` protocol.
- `node_modules` for both workspaces was missing at start; ran `npm ci` at the worktree root before the first `typecheck`/`lint` run, per the parallel-execution instructions.
- Two prettier formatting fixes were needed on files touched across tasks (`surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts` after Task 1, `epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` after Task 2) — both folded into the next task's commit with a note, since `npm run format:check` only surfaced them after subsequent edits to the same files.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- ROADMAP success criterion 2 (upsert cannot submit, move expires_at, or overwrite a submitted survey's read-only fields) is satisfied and proven end-to-end against real PostgreSQL with an installed-app payload replay.
- `patchSurvey`'s 422 `submitted_read_only_fields` contract is untouched; `submitSurvey`'s concurrent-submit handling (plan 03) is untouched.
- Full verification green in this worktree: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm --workspace api run test:unit` (153/153), `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` (500/500), and `npm --workspace api run test:e2e` against `ibp_p05_test` (77/77 = 76 baseline + 1 new suite).
