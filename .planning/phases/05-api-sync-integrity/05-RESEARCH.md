# Phase 01.4: API sync integrity - Research

**Researched:** 2026-09-24
**Domain:** NestJS API — request validation (class-validator/class-transformer), PostgreSQL transactions, optimistic/pessimistic concurrency control
**Confidence:** HIGH

## Summary

Phase 01.4 closes audit lots L8 (sync validation) and L9 (transactions/concurrency). Both problems
are narrowly scoped and the fixes are small, mechanical, and mostly reuse patterns that already
exist elsewhere in this codebase — they just haven't been applied to the `/v1/sync` batch path and
to `SurveysService`'s multi-statement writes.

The root cause of the validation gap (A-H2, A-M2, A-M5) is a single line:
`api/src/surveys/sync.controller.ts:18` types `@Body()` as `SyncBatchBody`, a plain TypeScript
type alias, not a class. Nest's global `ValidationPipe` (`whitelist`, `forbidNonWhitelisted`,
`transform: true`, set in `api/src/app.setup.ts:30-36`) only validates/transforms parameters whose
declared metatype is a class — for a type alias, the emitted design-type metadata is `Object`, and
Nest's `ValidationPipe.toValidate()` skips validation for `Object` entirely `[VERIFIED: codebase]`.
This is why `POST /v1/sync` payloads pass through completely unchecked while the REST endpoints
(`POST /v1/surveys`, `PATCH /v1/surveys/:id`, etc.) are already protected — they already use class
DTOs (`SurveyUpsertDto`, `SurveyPatchDto` in `api/src/surveys/dtos/`).

The root cause of the transaction gap (ARCH-3, A-M1, A-M7, A-M9) is that only `deleteAccount`
(`api/src/users/users.service.ts:255-339`) uses `db.connect()` + `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`/
`finally { client.release() }`. Every other multi-statement write in `SurveysService`,
`SurveysAttachmentsService`, and `ReportsService` calls `this.db.query(...)` directly against the
pool, i.e. autocommit per statement. `deleteAccount` is the template to extract into a reusable
`DatabaseService.transaction(fn)` helper — it already deletes the Auth0 user in the wrong order
relative to the DB transaction (A-M9), which this phase must also fix.

**Primary recommendation:** (1) Convert `SyncBatchBody`/`SyncOperation` into class DTOs validated
per-operation inside `SurveysSyncService.syncBatch` (not via the global pipe, which would reject the
whole batch on one bad operation) — reusing the existing `SurveyUpsertDto` for the upsert branch.
(2) Add a `DatabaseService.transaction<T>(fn: (db: Queryable) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>` helper
modeled on `deleteAccount`'s existing BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK block, thread a `Queryable` (pool or
client) through every service method that currently calls `this.db.query` directly in a
multi-statement write, and reorder `deleteAccount` to commit the DB transaction before calling
Auth0.

## Architectural Responsibility Map

| Capability | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Sync operation payload validation | API / Backend | — | `class-validator` DTOs run inside `SurveysSyncService`; this is server-side business validation per DEC-007 (server is source of truth) |
| Read-only field enforcement on submitted surveys | API / Backend | — | `getSubmittedReadOnlyFields` already exists and runs in `patchSurvey`; must also run in `upsertForUser` |
| Deterministic vs retryable error classification | API / Backend | — | `sync-error.utils.ts` maps errors before they reach the mobile client; mobile only reads `status: fatal_error \| retryable_error`, it does not re-classify |
| Transaction boundary per write | API / Backend | Database / Storage | Nest services own the transaction; PostgreSQL enforces the row lock / constraint that makes the transaction meaningful |
| Concurrent-submit conflict resolution | Database / Storage | API / Backend | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on `parcels` is a database-tier lock; the API translates the resulting `23505` into a `409` |
| Account deletion ordering | API / Backend | External (Auth0) | DB transaction must commit first because Auth0 deletion is irreversible and external; this is purely an ordering/sequencing concern inside `UsersService` |

## User Constraints

No `.planning/phases/05-api-sync-integrity/*-CONTEXT.md` exists — `/gsd:discuss-phase` has not
been run for this phase. There are no locked decisions or discretion notes to copy. The planner
should treat every design choice below as Claude's discretion, informed by the ROADMAP success
criteria (which are load-bearing and already precise) and by the PROJECT.md constraints:

- **CON-API-001** (locked): `/v1` prefix, Bearer auth, idempotent upsert on (`id`, `sync_version`), standard error codes.
- **CON-PROTO-002** (locked): fatal vs retryable sync error policy, retry cap of 8, error payload contract — the mobile client's existing `fatal_error`/`retryable_error` contract must not change shape, only which errors map to which status.
- **DEC-007 / DEC-008** (locked, ADR-001): server validates and is the source of truth; sync is idempotent — replaying a request must not duplicate records.
- Backward compatibility requirement from the phase goal: "installed apps keep working" — the mobile client currently always sends `status` and `expires_at` in every upsert payload (`mobile/src/storage/sync.ts:377,384`); the server must silently ignore these fields rather than reject the payload.

## Phase Requirements

| ID | Description | Research Support |
|----|-------------|------------------|
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | Sync operation payloads are validated by class DTOs; upsert ignores client `status`/`expires_at` and cannot overwrite a submitted survey; `parcel_ids` is bounded; deterministic database errors are fatal with generic messages | See "Don't Hand-Roll", "Architecture Patterns" Pattern 1-2, "Code Examples", "Common Pitfalls" 1-3 |
| REQ-AUD-transactions | Every multi-statement API write runs in one transaction with its event, the upsert is guarded on `sync_version`, concurrent submits on a parcel resolve to one success and one 409, and account deletion commits in the database before deleting the Auth0 user | See "Architecture Patterns" Pattern 3-4, "Code Examples", "Common Pitfalls" 4-6, "Validation Architecture" |

## Current-State Map (file:line)

### Validation gap (L8 / A-H2, A-M2, A-M5)

| Where | What's there today | What's wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `api/src/surveys/sync.controller.ts:18` | `@Body() body: SyncBatchBody` (type alias) | Global `ValidationPipe` silently skips validation for non-class metatypes `[VERIFIED: codebase + Nest source behavior]` |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.types.ts` (`SyncOperation`, `SyncBatchBody`, `SurveyUpsertBody`) | Plain `type` aliases | No decorators possible; these need class equivalents or a mapping layer |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys-sync.service.ts:60-63` | `operation.payload as SurveyUpsertBody` | Unchecked cast; any shape reaches `upsertForUser` |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:338` | `body.status ?? existing.status` in the `UPDATE` | Client-supplied `status` (including `"submitted"`) is written directly, bypassing `submitSurvey`'s validation, parcel-version check, and 7-day expiry |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:167-370` (`upsertForUser`) | No check of `existing.status === "submitted"` before applying body fields | Unlike `patchSurvey` (line 380), a submitted survey's read-only fields can be overwritten through upsert |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:203-204` | `body.expires_at ?? new Date(now + 7d)` used directly in both INSERT and UPDATE | Client-supplied `expires_at` moves the deadline; must be ignored/computed server-side |
| `api/src/surveys/dtos/survey-upsert.dto.ts` (existing, used only by the direct `POST /v1/surveys` REST route) | `parcel_ids?: string[]` with only `@IsArray()` / `@IsString({each:true})` | No `@ArrayMaxSize(20)`, no per-ID format check — same class needs these decorators added, and then needs to be reused for the `/sync` upsert path too |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:1375+` (`ensureParcelIds`) | Loops per parcel ID, can insert a `manual` parcel per unknown ID | Confirms A-M2's "10 000 IDs -> 10 000 parasite parcels" scenario is real; bounding array length in the DTO is the cheap fix, though `ensureParcelIds`'s per-ID round trip is an efficiency concern deferred to Phase 01.7 (`REQ-AUD-surveys-split`) unless the phase owner wants to batch it now |
| `api/src/surveys/sync-error.utils.ts:15` | `retryable = httpStatus >= 500 \|\| httpStatus === 429 : true` (default `true` when no `HttpException`) | Any raw `Error` (including `pg` driver errors with SQLSTATE `22xxx`/`23xxx`) defaults to `retryable_error`, and `extractSyncErrorPayload` falls back to `error.message`, which can leak a Postgres constraint name (`surveys_pkey`) to the client `[VERIFIED: codebase]` |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:1296-1333` (`getSurveyParcelIds`, `syncSurveyParcels`) | `catch` blocks swallow any error whose message contains `"survey_parcels"` | A-M1: masks real FK violations/deadlocks as "no parcels", losing data silently after the `DELETE` has already run |

### Transaction / concurrency gap (L9 / ARCH-3, A-M1, A-M7, A-M9)

| Where | What's there today | What's wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `api/src/database/database.service.ts` | `query()` wraps `pool.query`; `connect()` returns a raw `PoolClient`; no `transaction()` helper | Every caller that needs a transaction must hand-roll BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK/release (only `deleteAccount` does) |
| `api/src/users/users.service.ts:255-339` (`deleteAccount`) | **Already the one correct transaction pattern in the codebase**: `client = await this.db.connect()`, `BEGIN`, work, `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` in catch, `release()` in `finally` | Reusable as the template for the new `transaction()` helper. But line 261 calls `this.auth0Management.deleteUser(...)` **before** `BEGIN` (line 280) — A-M9: if the DB transaction then fails, the Auth0 account is already gone but the DB rows remain |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:167-370` (`upsertForUser`) | INSERT/UPDATE, then separately `syncSurveyParcels`, then separately `insertEvent` — three autocommit statements | If `insertEvent` throws after the UPDATE commits, the change never reaches `/sync/changes` (ARCH-3's exact scenario) and the client's retry hits the `sync_version === existing.sync_version` early return (line 304), silently accepting the loss |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:332` | `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2` (no `sync_version` guard in the `UPDATE` itself) | The optimistic-concurrency check happens in application code (lines 292-312) as a read-then-write — a classic TOCTOU race: two concurrent upserts with the same `sync_version` can both pass the check and both `UPDATE`, one silently overwriting the other. Success criterion 3 requires `AND sync_version < $n` in the `UPDATE` and reacting to zero affected rows |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:1493-1509` (`getDefaultVersionNumber`) | `SELECT COALESCE(MAX(version_number),0)+1 ... WHERE parcel_id = $1 AND status='submitted'` — plain `SELECT`, no lock | Two concurrent `submitSurvey` calls on the same parcel both compute the same `next_version`; the second `UPDATE ... SET version_number` collides on a unique constraint, producing an unmapped `23505` -> unhandled -> `500` (A-M7, confirmed: no `try/catch` around this path in `submitSurvey`, `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:607-694`) |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:696-760` (`deleteSurvey`) | SELECT attachments, UPDATE attachments, loop cleanup, UPDATE surveys — all separate autocommit statements, no event insert visible in the excerpt read | Needs the same transaction treatment; verify during planning whether `deleteSurvey` also calls `insertEvent` further down (not shown in the 140-line excerpt read — planner/executor should grep the remainder of the method, lines 760+) |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts` (`createAttachment`, `deleteAttachment`) | Multiple `this.db.query` calls per method, no `BEGIN` | Same ARCH-3 pattern; attachment metadata write + its event insert need one transaction |
| `api/src/reports/reports.service.ts` (`createReport`) | `this.db.query` for the report INSERT, then a separate `this.db.query` for the event | Same pattern; needs one transaction |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:1263-1274` (`insertEvent`) | Private method, always called with `this.db.query` (the pool) | Must become `(db: Queryable, ...)` so it can run inside the caller's transaction client instead of always using the pool |

## Standard Stack

### Core (already installed — no new packages needed for this phase)

| Library | Version (installed) | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `class-validator` | `^0.15.1` `[VERIFIED: npm view / api/package.json]` | Per-field decorators (`@IsString`, `@IsEnum`, `@ArrayMaxSize`, `@Matches`, `@ValidateNested`) | Already the project's DTO validation library (see `api/src/surveys/dtos/*.ts`); NestJS's blessed choice |
| `class-transformer` | `^0.5.1` `[VERIFIED: npm view / api/package.json]` | `plainToInstance` for manual per-operation validation inside `syncBatch` | Already a dependency; needed for the per-operation dispatch pattern below |
| `pg` | `^8.20.0` `[VERIFIED: api/package.json]` | `PoolClient.query`, `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` | Already the project's only DB driver (raw SQL, no ORM per ADR-001) |

**No installation step required.** This phase is a refactor of existing dependencies, not a new
integration. The Package Legitimacy Audit is not applicable — no new packages are introduced.

### Alternatives Considered

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Manual per-operation `plainToInstance`/`validate()` dispatch inside `syncBatch` | `class-transformer`'s built-in discriminator (`@Type(() => Base, { discriminator: { property, subTypes }})`) on a single `SyncOperationDto` hierarchy | class-transformer's discriminator switches on **one** property value (e.g. `type: "upsert"`). This codebase's operations are discriminated by **two** fields (`entity` + `action`, e.g. `survey.upsert`, `attachment.delete`) — not natively supported as a single discriminator. Composing a synthetic `${entity}.${action}` discriminant would require a custom `@Transform` step before class-transformer's discrimination logic, which is more indirection than just keeping the existing `if (operation.entity === "survey" && operation.action === "upsert")` branches in `syncBatch` and validating each operation's envelope + payload manually inside each branch. **Recommendation: keep the existing if/else dispatch structure, add validation inside each branch, do not attempt a single discriminated-union DTO tree.** |
| Row-level app-computed version numbers guarded only by an app-level `if` | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the locked `parcels` rows during `submitSurvey`, or a DB-level `UNIQUE (parcel_id, version_number)` constraint relied on for conflict detection | `FOR UPDATE` is simpler to reason about for this codebase's scale (one VPS, no read replicas) and matches the audit's own recommendation (`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md:172`). A unique constraint + catching `23505` is a valid fallback if a lock is judged too heavy, and should still be added as defense-in-depth regardless |
| Hand-rolled per-service `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` blocks | One `DatabaseService.transaction<T>(fn)` helper | Every service duplicating `deleteAccount`'s 8-line boilerplate is the exact "don't hand-roll" anti-pattern; one helper is the industry-standard approach for the `pg` library and is trivial to add here since the working example already exists in the codebase |

## Architecture Patterns

### System Architecture Diagram

```
Mobile client (installed app)
   │  POST /v1/sync  { operations: [...] }
   ▼
SyncController.syncBatch (sync.controller.ts)
   │  @Body() SyncBatchDto  ← [NEW class DTO; replaces plain-type SyncBatchBody]
   ▼
SurveysSyncService.syncBatch (surveys-sync.service.ts)
   │  for each operation:
   │    1. validate envelope (entity/action/survey_id/client_ref) via class-validator
   │    2. plainToInstance + validate the operation-specific payload DTO
   │       (SurveyUpsertDto reused; new AttachmentCreateDto / DeleteDto if missing)
   │    3. on validation failure → push {status:"fatal_error", error:{...generic}}, continue loop
   │    4. on success → dispatch to the relevant service method, WITHIN one DB transaction
   ▼                                              ▼
SurveysService.upsertForUser              SurveysAttachmentsService.createAttachment /
  (strip client status/expires_at;         deleteAttachment
   enforce submitted-read-only fields;        │
   guard UPDATE ...AND sync_version < $n)     │
   │                                          │
   ▼                                          ▼
DatabaseService.transaction(async (db) => {   ...same pattern...
  UPDATE/INSERT survey row
  syncSurveyParcels(db, ...)     ← re-throws instead of swallowing (A-M1 fix)
  insertEvent(db, ...)           ← same transaction, so a failure here rolls back the row write
})
   │
   ▼
PostgreSQL (survey_events, surveys, survey_parcels, attachments, reports)
   │
   ▼
mapSyncError(error)  ← 22xxx/23xxx → fatal_error, generic message; everything else → retryable_error
   │
   ▼
{ results: [ { client_ref, entity, action, status, data | error } ] }  → mobile client

Separate path (unchanged by this phase, but depends on the same UPDATE guard):
POST /v1/surveys/:id/submit → SurveysService.submitSurvey
   → SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on locked parcels  [NEW]
   → compute version_number under the lock
   → UPDATE surveys SET status='submitted' ... in the SAME transaction as insertEvent
   → 23505 residual → mapped to 409 (not 500)

UsersService.deleteAccount (reordered):
   BEGIN → anonymize/delete DB rows → COMMIT  [moved before Auth0 call]
   → THEN auth0Management.deleteUser(...)
   → if Auth0 call fails: log error + mark user row `pending_auth0_deletion` (or a retry job)
```

```

### Pattern 1: Class DTO required for `ValidationPipe` to activate

**What:** Nest's `ValidationPipe` only validates parameters whose reflected design-type is a class
with `class-validator` decorators. A `type` alias reflects as `Object` at runtime and is skipped.
**When to use:** Any `@Body()`/`@Query()`/`@Param()` parameter that must be validated.
**Example (existing, correct pattern already in this codebase):**
```typescript
// Source: api/src/surveys/dtos/survey-upsert.dto.ts + surveys.controller.ts:50-52
export class SurveyUpsertDto {
  @IsOptional() @IsString() id?: string
  @IsOptional() @IsNumber() sync_version?: number
  // ...
}

@Post()
async upsert(@CurrentUser() user: AuthenticatedUser, @Body() body: SurveyUpsertDto) {
  return this.surveysService.upsertForUser(user, body)
}
```
Apply the identical pattern to `sync.controller.ts`, replacing `SyncBatchBody` with a `SyncBatchDto`
class. Because the whole batch must not be rejected on one bad operation (per success criterion 1:
"a per-operation fatal_error... instead of a retried 500"), the *outer* envelope (`operations` is an
array, batch size ≤ 100) can be validated by the global pipe, but *each operation's payload* must be
validated manually inside `syncBatch`'s loop — see Pattern 2.

### Pattern 2: Per-operation manual validation inside a loop (not a single discriminated-union DTO)

**What:** `plainToInstance` + `validate()` called explicitly per operation, inside the existing
if/else dispatch in `SurveysSyncService.syncBatch`.
**When to use:** When a batch of heterogeneous items must each fail independently rather than
failing the whole request.
**Example:**
```typescript
// Source: class-transformer/class-validator official docs (plainToInstance + validate)
import { plainToInstance } from "class-transformer"
import { validate } from "class-validator"

async function validatePayload<T extends object>(
  cls: new () => T,
  payload: unknown,
): Promise<T> {
  const instance = plainToInstance(cls, payload)
  const errors = await validate(instance, { whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true })
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    throw new BadRequestException("Invalid operation payload")
  }
  return instance
}

// inside syncBatch's existing branch:
if (operation.entity === "survey" && operation.action === "upsert") {
  const dto = await validatePayload(SurveyUpsertDto, operation.payload)
  const data = await this.surveysService.upsertForUser(user, dto)
  // ...
}
```
The existing `try { ... } catch (error) { const mapped = mapSyncError(error) ... }` wrapper around
each operation (already in `surveys-sync.service.ts:59-190`) means a `BadRequestException` thrown
here already produces a per-operation `fatal_error` result — **no change needed to the error
handling shell, only to what gets validated before the service call.**

### Pattern 3: Reusable transaction helper

**What:** A single `DatabaseService.transaction<T>(fn)` method, modeled directly on the existing
correct pattern in `deleteAccount`.
**When to use:** Any write that touches more than one table or must pair with an `insertEvent`.
**Example:**
```typescript
// Source: derived from api/src/users/users.service.ts:263-328 (existing pattern, generalized)
import { Pool, PoolClient, QueryResult, QueryResultRow } from "pg"

export interface Queryable {
  query<T extends QueryResultRow = QueryResultRow>(
    text: string,
    values?: unknown[],
  ): Promise<QueryResult<T>>
}

// in DatabaseService:
async transaction<T>(fn: (db: Queryable) => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  const client = await this.pool.connect()
  try {
    await client.query("BEGIN")
    const result = await fn(client)
    await client.query("COMMIT")
    return result
  } catch (error) {
    await client.query("ROLLBACK").catch(() => undefined)
    throw error
  } finally {
    client.release()
  }
}
```
Every service method that writes + calls `insertEvent` becomes:
```typescript
async upsertForUser(user: AuthenticatedUser, body: SurveyUpsertDto) {
  return this.db.transaction(async (db) => {
    // ...existing logic, but every this.db.query(...) becomes db.query(...)
    await this.syncSurveyParcels(db, body.id, selectedParcelIds)
    await this.insertEvent(db, body.id, user.id, "updated", { ... })
    return { ... }
  })
}
```
`insertEvent`, `syncSurveyParcels`, `ensureParcelIds`, and any other private helper called from
inside a transaction must accept `db: Queryable` as their first parameter instead of implicitly
using `this.db` (the pool), or the transaction has no effect (statements would still autocommit
against a different connection).

### Pattern 4: Optimistic concurrency guard in the `UPDATE` itself, plus a row lock for submit

**What:** Move the `sync_version` check from a read-then-write race into the `UPDATE`'s `WHERE`
clause; use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to serialize concurrent submits on the same parcel.
**Example:**
```sql
-- upsert guard (inside the transaction from Pattern 3)
UPDATE surveys
SET ... , sync_version = $17, updated_at = $18
WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2 AND sync_version < $17
RETURNING id, updated_at::text
-- if rowCount === 0: re-SELECT to distinguish "already at this version" (idempotent replay,
-- per DEC-008) from "someone else won" (real conflict) and respond accordingly

-- submit lock (inside submitSurvey's transaction)
SELECT parcel_id FROM parcels WHERE parcel_id = ANY($1::text[]) FOR UPDATE
-- ... then compute next_version_number using the same transaction/client, still inside the lock
UPDATE surveys SET status='submitted', version_number = $2, ... WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $3
-- a residual 23505 (unique violation on (parcel_id, version_number) if such a constraint exists,
-- or on any other race) must be caught and re-thrown as ConflictException, not left as a 500
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Swallowing errors by string-matching the message** (`api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:1305-1312, 1327-1333`): `catch (error) { if (message.includes("survey_parcels")) return [] }` hides real failures (FK violations, deadlocks) as if nothing happened, after a `DELETE` already ran. Remove entirely — this was migration-009 compatibility code that's no longer needed (per the audit).
- **Validating a batch as one unit when partial failure must be possible.** Do not wrap the entire `operations` array in a single class-validator pass expecting per-item errors to surface individually through Nest's default `BadRequestException` — that would reject the whole batch with one 400, contradicting success criterion 1's "per-operation fatal_error, rest of the batch not rejected" requirement (confirmed by the French audit text: "le reste du lot n'est pas rejeté").
- **Trusting `httpStatus === undefined` as retryable by default** in `sync-error.utils.ts`. This is the current behavior and is exactly backwards for deterministic `pg` errors, which never carry an `HttpException`. The fix must special-case `pg` error objects (`error.code` matching `/^(22|23)/`) before falling through to the generic default.
- **Reordering delete-then-check.** `deleteAccount`'s Auth0-then-DB order is backwards precisely because Auth0 deletion is irreversible; always commit the reversible/local side effect first when pairing a DB transaction with an external, irreversible API call.

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Per-operation payload validation with independent pass/fail | A custom validator function per operation type re-implementing field checks | `class-validator`'s `validate()` + existing `SurveyUpsertDto` (extend with the missing `@ArrayMaxSize`/`@Matches`) | The DTOs already exist for the REST endpoints; duplicating field rules for the `/sync` path would immediately drift from the REST path's rules |
| Discriminated-union request shape (entity × action) | A single class hierarchy using `class-transformer`'s `discriminator` option keyed on a synthesized composite field | The existing `if (operation.entity === X && operation.action === Y)` branch dispatch, with validation added per branch | class-transformer's discriminator switches on one property value; forcing a two-field discriminant through it adds a `@Transform` pre-step for no real benefit over keeping the current explicit dispatch |
| Transaction management | Per-service `BEGIN`/COMMIT/ROLLBACK boilerplate | One `DatabaseService.transaction(fn)` helper (Pattern 3) | `deleteAccount` already proves the correct 8-line pattern works; multiplying it by hand in 5+ call sites is the literal anti-pattern the audit is flagging (ARCH-3) |
| Row-level locking for concurrent submits | An application-level mutex, distributed lock, or retry-with-backoff loop around `getDefaultVersionNumber` | PostgreSQL's native `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside the existing transaction | This is a single-instance PostgreSQL setup (ADR-001, no read replicas); a DB-native row lock is simpler and more correct than any app-level coordination, and matches the audit's own recommendation |

**Key insight:** Nothing in this phase requires a new library or an unfamiliar pattern — every fix
either extends a DTO class that already exists, or generalizes a transaction pattern (`deleteAccount`)
that already exists correctly in this exact codebase. The risk is entirely in *finding every call
site* that needs the fix (there are ~6 write paths: upsert, patch/submit, delete, attachment
create/delete, report create), not in inventing new mechanisms.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Fixing validation at the controller level only, breaking partial-batch semantics
**What goes wrong:** Wrapping `SyncBatchDto.operations` with `@ValidateNested({ each: true })` and a
single discriminated-union payload type causes the global `ValidationPipe` to reject the entire
`POST /v1/sync` request with one 400 the moment any single operation's payload is malformed.
**Why it happens:** This is the "obvious" NestJS-idiomatic way to validate nested arrays, but it
doesn't compose with "per-operation fatal_error, rest of the batch proceeds."
**How to avoid:** Validate only the envelope shape (array bounds, presence of `entity`/`action`) via
the class DTO; validate each operation's `payload` manually inside `syncBatch`'s loop, per Pattern 2.
**Warning signs:** An E2E test sending one bad operation among several good ones gets a raw 400 with
no `results` array, instead of a 200 with mixed `synced`/`fatal_error` entries.

### Pitfall 2: Forgetting to thread the transaction client through private helpers
**What goes wrong:** `insertEvent`, `syncSurveyParcels`, `ensureParcelIds`, `getSurveyForUser`, etc.
are currently written against `this.db` (the pool). Wrapping the *public* method in
`this.db.transaction(fn)` does nothing if these private helpers keep calling `this.db.query`
directly instead of the `db: Queryable` passed into `fn`.
**Why it happens:** Easy to miss in a 1570-line service file; TypeScript won't catch it since both
the pool and a `PoolClient` satisfy a `Queryable` interface with the same method signature.
**How to avoid:** Grep for `this.db.query` inside every method that will run inside a transaction
after this phase, and confirm each call originates from the injected `db` parameter, not `this.db`.
**Warning signs:** The E2E test "injected failure on `insertEvent` leaves nothing committed" passes
locally by luck (if the failure happens to occur before any other statement) but a variant that
injects failure on a *later* statement in the same method reveals partial commits.

### Pitfall 3: `mapSyncError` misclassifying `pg` errors that already got wrapped in an `HttpException`
**What goes wrong:** If a service catches a raw `pg` error and rethrows it wrapped in a generic
`InternalServerErrorException(error.message)` before it reaches `syncBatch`'s catch block, the
original `error.code` (e.g. `23505`) is lost, and `mapSyncError` can no longer detect it deterministically — it will fall through to the `httpStatus >= 500` branch and mark it retryable.
**Why it happens:** Generic catch-and-wrap is a common instinct; NestJS's own exception filters do this by default for uncaught errors.
**How to avoid:** Let raw `pg` errors (with `.code`) propagate uncaught out of the service method into `syncBatch`'s existing `catch (error) { mapSyncError(error) }`; do the 22xxx/23xxx classification inside `mapSyncError` itself by checking `(error as { code?: string }).code`, not by pre-classifying inside the service.
**Warning signs:** A duplicate-key test expects `fatal_error`/`409` but observes `retryable_error`.

### Pitfall 4: `FOR UPDATE` deadlocks if parcel IDs aren't locked in a consistent order
**What goes wrong:** `submitSurvey` locks `parcels` rows via `SELECT ... WHERE parcel_id = ANY($1) FOR UPDATE`. If two submits reference overlapping multi-parcel sets in different orders, they can deadlock.
**Why it happens:** PostgreSQL doesn't automatically order `ANY($1)` lookups; row lock acquisition order follows physical/index scan order, which can differ between the two queries if `parcel_ids` arrays aren't sorted identically.
**How to avoid:** Sort `parcel_ids` before the `FOR UPDATE` query (parcel IDs are already normalized/deduplicated by `normalizeParcelIds`; also `.sort()` them before the query) so any two overlapping submits acquire locks in the same order.
**Warning signs:** The concurrent-submit E2E test is flaky — passes most runs, occasionally times out or throws a deadlock error (`40P01`) instead of returning 201/409.

### Pitfall 5: Reordering `deleteAccount` without handling the Auth0-failure case
**What goes wrong:** Simply swapping the two calls (DB transaction first, then `auth0Management.deleteUser`) fixes A-M9's main risk but introduces a new one: if the DB transaction now succeeds and the subsequent Auth0 call throws, the local user row is already gone/anonymized but the Auth0 account survives — the user can still log in with a DB-less session (auto-provisioning would recreate a fresh user row on next login, which may be acceptable but should be a conscious decision).
**Why it happens:** The two systems don't share a two-phase commit; some inconsistency window is unavoidable once you pick an order.
**How to avoid:** Per the audit's own recommendation and success criterion 5 ("commits the database transaction before deleting the Auth0 user"), accept that ordering and add a fallback for the Auth0-failure branch — at minimum log the error clearly (the audit suggests a `pending_auth0_deletion` status or a retry job; given DEC-002's "no team, single developer" constraint, a structured log line plus a documented manual remediation step is a reasonable MVP scope, with a retry job as a stretch goal).
**Warning signs:** Silent Auth0 API failures with no operator-visible signal.

### Pitfall 6: Breaking installed-app compatibility by rejecting `status`/`expires_at` instead of ignoring them
**What goes wrong:** If the new `SurveyUpsertDto` (or its validation logic) throws when `status` or `expires_at` are present in a sync-path upsert payload, every installed mobile app breaks immediately, since `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts:377,384` always sends both fields.
**Why it happens:** "Reject invalid/unexpected fields" is the class-validator/`forbidNonWhitelisted` default instinct, and it's the *wrong* instinct here specifically because these two fields are expected-but-ignored, not invalid.
**How to avoid:** Keep `status` and `expires_at` as valid (whitelisted) optional fields on the DTO so they pass validation, but have `upsertForUser`'s business logic silently discard them (never read `body.status` for anything other than rejecting `"submitted"` if a stricter check is wanted, and never read `body.expires_at` at all — always compute server-side).
**Warning signs:** An E2E test replaying today's exact mobile payload shape (with `status: "draft"`, `expires_at: <iso string>`) starts failing after this phase's DTO changes.

## Code Examples

### Detecting a `pg` deterministic error by SQLSTATE class
```typescript
// Source: node-postgres (pg) error objects expose `.code` as the 5-char SQLSTATE;
// classes 22 (data exception) and 23 (integrity constraint violation) are always
// deterministic — retrying the identical payload will always fail the same way.
// https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html (official PostgreSQL docs)
function isDeterministicPgError(error: unknown): error is { code: string } {
  return (
    typeof error === "object" &&
    error !== null &&
    "code" in error &&
    typeof (error as { code?: unknown }).code === "string" &&
    /^(22|23)/.test((error as { code: string }).code)
  )
}

// inside mapSyncError, before the existing HttpException branch:
if (isDeterministicPgError(error)) {
  return {
    status: "fatal_error",
    error: { code: "invalid_operation", message: "Operation could not be processed" },
    // no `details`: do not leak constraint name / raw pg message
  }
}
```

### `parcel_ids` bounding + format validation on the DTO
```typescript
// Source: class-validator official docs (ArrayMaxSize, Matches)
// https://github.com/typestack/class-validator
import { ArrayMaxSize, IsArray, IsOptional, IsString, Matches } from "class-validator"

// Cadastral ID format already enforced informally by parseParcelIdentifier's regex
// (api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts:129): 5-digit commune code,
// 1-3 letter section, 1-4 digit number.
const PARCEL_ID_PATTERN = /^\d{5}[A-Z]{1,3}\d{1,4}$/

export class SurveyUpsertDto {
  // ...existing fields...

  @IsOptional()
  @IsArray()
  @ArrayMaxSize(20)
  @IsString({ each: true })
  @Matches(PARCEL_ID_PATTERN, { each: true })
  parcel_ids?: string[]
}
```

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| n/a — this is a codebase-internal remediation, not a framework upgrade | n/a | n/a | No external ecosystem shift is relevant here; `class-validator` 0.15.1 and NestJS 11 are both current and already installed |

**Deprecated/outdated:** None identified relevant to this phase.

## Assumptions Log

| # | Claim | Section | Risk if Wrong |
|---|-------|---------|---------------|
| A1 | A `UNIQUE (parcel_id, version_number)` constraint (or equivalent) exists or should be added so a residual race after `FOR UPDATE` still surfaces as `23505` rather than silently succeeding with a duplicate version | Pattern 4, Pitfall 4 | If no such constraint exists today, the planner must add one via migration as part of this phase, or the `FOR UPDATE` lock is the *only* safety net (acceptable, but should be a deliberate choice, not an oversight) — **verify via `grep -rn "version_number" api/migrations/` during planning** |
| A2 | `deleteSurvey` (lines 696-760+ read) does not yet write a `survey_events` "deleted" entry within the excerpt read; the full method (beyond line 760) was not read in this research pass | Current-State Map | If `deleteSurvey` already calls `insertEvent` further down, the transaction wrap is simpler (one more statement to include); if it doesn't, the planner may need to decide whether a "deleted" event should be added as part of this phase or is out of scope — **read the remainder of `deleteSurvey` (lines 760-830ish) during planning** |
| A3 | "Deterministic PostgreSQL errors (22xxx/23xxx) are never retryable" should be implemented as a check on the raw `error.code` inside `mapSyncError`, reached by letting `pg` errors propagate uncaught rather than being pre-wrapped by service-level try/catch | Pitfall 3 | If some call sites already wrap `pg` errors in a custom exception that discards `.code`, `mapSyncError`'s new check won't see it — the planner must audit for such wrapping (spot check found none in `surveys.service.ts`'s write paths, but attachment/report services were only grep-scanned, not fully read) |

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

Resolved 2026-09-24, see 05-CONTEXT.md: Q1 → D-02 (as recommended); Q2 → D-07 (as recommended); Q3 → D-10 (log only, as recommended). `parcel_ids` bound set to 50 by the owner (D-01), replacing the 20 used in the examples below.

1. **Should the outer `SyncBatchDto` envelope validation (array shape, `client_ref`/`entity`/`action` types) go through the global `ValidationPipe` at the controller, or be validated manually inside `syncBatch` alongside the per-operation payloads?**
   - What we know: The envelope fields (not the polymorphic `payload`) are simple and don't vary by operation type — a class DTO with `@IsIn(["survey","attachment"])` etc. on the *envelope* would validate cleanly through the global pipe without blocking partial-batch semantics, since only `payload`'s shape varies per branch.
   - What's unclear: Whether an envelope-level validation failure (e.g., `entity` is `123` instead of a string) should also produce a per-operation `fatal_error` (requiring it to also be validated manually) or can safely 400 the whole batch (since a malformed envelope suggests a broken/malicious client, not a legitimate operation that happens to be invalid).
   - Recommendation: Validate the *array bounds* (`operations.length` between 1 and 100 — already enforced in code, lines 37-42) via the global pipe on `SyncBatchDto`; validate each operation's *envelope fields* (`entity`, `action`, `survey_id`, `client_ref`) manually per-operation alongside its `payload`, so every operation-level problem (malformed envelope or malformed payload) produces a `fatal_error` entry rather than rejecting the whole batch. This is simpler to reason about and matches "a per-operation fatal_error... instead of a retried 500" literally.

2. **Does `deleteSurvey` need transaction coverage that also spans the object-storage cleanup (`cleanupAttachmentStorage`), or only the DB writes?**
   - What we know: `cleanupAttachmentStorage` (S3/local filesystem deletion) cannot participate in a PostgreSQL transaction — it's a separate system with no two-phase commit available.
   - What's unclear: Whether success criterion 3's "delete... run in one transaction with their event" means only the DB writes (soft-delete of `surveys`/`attachments` rows + event insert) or is expected to also somehow guard the physical file deletion.
   - Recommendation: Scope the transaction to the DB writes only (mark rows `deleted_at`, insert the event) and keep physical storage cleanup as a best-effort post-commit step, exactly as `deleteAccount` already does today (storage cleanup happens *after* the transaction commits, lines 330-338) — this is the correct and consistent pattern already established in this codebase.

3. **What is the exact remediation for a failed Auth0 deletion after the DB transaction commits (success criterion 5's implicit follow-up)?**
   - What we know: The audit's own text offers "un job de relance, ou au minimum un log d'erreur et un statut `pending_auth0_deletion`" (a retry job, or at minimum an error log and a `pending_auth0_deletion` status) as options, not a mandate.
   - What's unclear: Whether adding a `pending_auth0_deletion` status requires a schema migration (new enum value or column) in this phase, or whether a structured log line is sufficient for a solo-developer, internal-only project at this milestone stage.
   - Recommendation: Given DEC-002 (single service) and PROJECT.md's "Solo: one developer plus Claude" constraint, scope this phase to structured logging (Nest `Logger.error` with the user ID and Auth0 sub) on Auth0-deletion failure, without a new DB column/status — this satisfies "at minimum a log of the error" and avoids scope creep into a retry-job feature. Flag this as a decision for the phase owner in `/gsd:discuss-phase` if not already settled.

## Environment Availability

No new external dependencies, services, or CLI tools are introduced by this phase. `PostgreSQL 16`, `Node 20+`, and the existing npm workspace toolchain are already required and available per `CLAUDE.md`. Skipped — no external dependencies beyond what's already running in this repo.

## Validation Architecture

### Test Framework

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework | Jest 29 + ts-jest; Supertest for E2E `[VERIFIED: package.json / CLAUDE.md]` |
| Config file | `api/jest.unit.config.js` (unit, `*.spec.ts`), `api/jest.config.js` (E2E, `*.e2e-spec.ts`) |
| Quick run command | `npm --workspace api run test:unit -- surveys` (targeted) or full `npm run test:unit` |
| Full suite command | `npm run test` (unit + E2E; E2E requires the `ibp_test` DB, reset by `global-setup.js`) |

### Phase Requirements → Test Map

| Req ID | Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists? |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | Invalid `/v1/sync` operation payload yields per-operation `fatal_error`, not a 500 | E2E | `npm --workspace api run test:e2e -- surveys-sync-validation` | ❌ Wave 0 — new file |
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | `expires_at: "abc"` in a sync upsert yields `fatal_error`, not a retried 500 | E2E | same file as above | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | A sync upsert with `status: "submitted"` does not submit the survey | E2E | same file | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | Upsert on a `submitted` survey changing a read-only field returns 409 `survey_submitted_read_only` | E2E | same file | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | 21 `parcel_ids` are refused (bounded at 20) | E2E | same file, or extend `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | Deterministic `pg` error (22xxx/23xxx) maps to `fatal_error` with a generic message (no constraint name leaked) | Unit | `jest --config jest.unit.config.js sync-error.utils` | ❌ Wave 0 — new `sync-error.utils.spec.ts` |
| REQ-AUD-transactions | Injected failure on `insertEvent` inside `upsertForUser` leaves nothing committed | E2E | `npm --workspace api run test:e2e -- surveys-transactions` (spy on `DatabaseService` obtained via `moduleFixture.get(DatabaseService)`, matching the existing pattern in `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts:33`) | ❌ Wave 0 — new file |
| REQ-AUD-transactions | Two concurrent `POST /v1/surveys/:id/submit` on the same parcel: one 201, one 409 | E2E | same file, `Promise.all([...])` against two survey IDs sharing a parcel | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-transactions | Concurrent upsert with the same `sync_version` gives exactly one winner | E2E | same file | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-transactions | `deleteAccount` commits DB before calling Auth0; Auth0 failure after commit is logged, DB rows already gone | Unit | `jest --config jest.unit.config.js users.service` (extend existing `users.service.spec.ts`, mock `Auth0ManagementService` to throw) | ✅ existing file, extend |
| REQ-AUD-transactions | `DatabaseService.transaction(fn)` commits on success, rolls back on throw, always releases the client | Unit | new `database.service.spec.ts` | ❌ Wave 0 — new file |

### Sampling Rate
- **Per task commit:** `npm --workspace api run test:unit -- <touched-module>`
- **Per wave merge:** `npm run test` (unit + E2E)
- **Phase gate:** Full suite green before `/gsd:verify-work`; coverage ratchet in `api/jest.unit.config.js` (`./src/surveys/`, `./src/database/`, `./src/users/`, `./src/reports/` thresholds) must not be lowered — this phase should *raise* the `./src/surveys/` and `./src/database/` floors given the new unit tests, per Phase 01.3's ratchet convention (`scripts/coverage-by-directory.js api` to regenerate).

### Wave 0 Gaps
- [ ] `api/test/surveys-sync-validation.e2e-spec.ts` — covers REQ-AUD-sync-validation (invalid payloads, status/expires_at bypass, read-only enforcement, parcel_ids bound)
- [ ] `api/test/surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` — covers REQ-AUD-transactions (injected event-insert failure, concurrent submit, concurrent upsert)
- [ ] `api/src/database/database.service.spec.ts` — covers the new `transaction()` helper in isolation
- [ ] `api/src/surveys/sync-error.utils.spec.ts` — covers 22xxx/23xxx classification and message redaction
- [ ] Extend `api/test/users.service.spec.ts` — covers `deleteAccount` reordering
- [ ] No new framework install needed — Jest/Supertest/`ibp_test` DB reset already exist from Phase 01.3

## Security Domain

### Applicable ASVS Categories

| ASVS Category | Applies | Standard Control |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| V2 Authentication | no | Unchanged by this phase (Auth0/JWT already in place, `AuthGuard` untouched) |
| V3 Session Management | no | N/A — stateless backend (DEC-005) |
| V4 Access Control | yes | All affected methods already scope by `WHERE user_id = $2`; this phase must not weaken that — every transaction-wrapped query must keep the `user_id` predicate |
| V5 Input Validation | yes | `class-validator` DTOs for every `/v1/sync` operation payload (this phase's core deliverable); `@ArrayMaxSize`, `@Matches`, `@IsEnum` on all client-controlled fields |
| V6 Cryptography | no | Not touched by this phase |

### Known Threat Patterns for this stack

| Pattern | STRIDE | Standard Mitigation |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Privilege escalation via unvalidated `status` field (client sets `status: "submitted"` to bypass business rules) | Tampering / Elevation of Privilege | Server ignores client `status` on upsert; submission only through the dedicated, fully-validated `submitSurvey` path (this phase's fix) |
| Information disclosure via raw database error messages (constraint names, schema details) reaching the client | Information Disclosure | `mapSyncError` returns a generic message for 22xxx/23xxx classes; raw `error.message`/constraint names are logged server-side only, never returned (this phase's fix) |
| Race condition / TOCTOU on optimistic concurrency check (read-then-write `sync_version` comparison) | Tampering | Guard the `UPDATE` itself with `AND sync_version < $n`; treat zero-row-affected as requiring a re-check, not as success (this phase's fix) |
| Resource exhaustion via unbounded array input (`parcel_ids` with thousands of entries creating parasite rows) | Denial of Service | `@ArrayMaxSize(20)` on the DTO (this phase's fix); the batch size cap (100 operations) already exists at `surveys-sync.service.ts:41` |
| TOCTOU on Auth0 deletion (external-service call before local transaction, or vice versa without accounting for failure) | Tampering / Repudiation | Commit the reversible local transaction before the irreversible external call; log failures of the external call explicitly (this phase's fix, see Open Question 3) |

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH — no new libraries; exact versions read from `api/package.json`
- Architecture: HIGH — every pattern proposed is either already implemented correctly elsewhere in this codebase (`deleteAccount`'s transaction, `SurveyUpsertDto`'s class-DTO pattern) or is a direct, literal implementation of the audit's own French-language recommendation
- Pitfalls: HIGH — each pitfall traces to a specific line/behavior read in this session, not inferred generically

**Research date:** 2026-09-24
**Valid until:** 2026-10-24 (30 days; this is an internal-codebase remediation, not dependent on external ecosystem churn — revalidate sooner only if `surveys.service.ts`/`sync.controller.ts` change materially before planning starts)
