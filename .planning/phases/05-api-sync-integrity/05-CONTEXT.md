# Phase 01.4: API sync integrity - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-09-24
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Owner decisions taken during `/gsd:plan-phase 1.4` after research (no discuss-phase run), plus the audit decisions in `.planning/PROJECT.md` → Key Decisions

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Audit lots L8 and L9 (`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md`): `POST /v1/sync` operations are validated per operation by class DTOs; upsert can no longer submit a survey, move `expires_at` or overwrite a submitted survey's read-only fields; deterministic PostgreSQL errors are fatal with generic messages; every multi-statement API write runs in one transaction with its event; the upsert is guarded on `sync_version`; concurrent submits on a parcel resolve to one success and one 409; account deletion commits in the database before deleting the Auth0 user. Installed mobile apps must keep syncing without an app update.

## Implementation Decisions

### Validation (REQ-AUD-sync-validation)
- D-01: `parcel_ids` is bounded with `@ArrayMaxSize(50)` (owner decision; the audit suggested 20) plus a format check on each cadastral ID. The same DTO rule applies to the REST route and the `/sync` upsert path.
- D-02: The batch array bounds (1..100 operations) are validated at the controller; each operation's envelope (`entity`, `action`, `survey_id`, `client_ref`) and payload are validated per operation inside `syncBatch`, so one bad operation yields a per-operation `fatal_error` with a generic message and the rest of the batch proceeds (research Open Question 1).
- D-03: Backward compatibility: installed apps always send `status` and `expires_at` in upsert payloads. These fields stay accepted by the DTO and are silently ignored by the server; they must never cause a rejection.
- D-04: Upsert on a submitted survey: a change to a read-only field (per the existing `getSubmittedReadOnlyFields`) is rejected (409 / `survey_submitted_read_only` as a per-operation fatal result); resending identical values must not be rejected, so an app re-syncing an unchanged submitted survey keeps working.
- D-05: PostgreSQL errors of class 22xxx and 23xxx are fatal (never retryable) and return a generic message with no SQL detail.

### Transactions (REQ-AUD-transactions)
- D-06: A `DatabaseService.transaction<T>(fn)` helper, generalised from the existing `UsersService.deleteAccount` pattern, is used by upsert, patch, submit, delete, attachment create/delete and report create, each with its event insert inside the same transaction.
- D-07: Object-storage cleanup is not part of any transaction; it stays best-effort after commit (research Open Question 2).
- D-08: Concurrent submits: row locks on the affected parcels taken in sorted order, plus mapping of any residual `23505` to 409. Never a 500 or a duplicate version.
- D-09: The A-M1 error-swallowing catches in parcel linkage are removed so failures abort the transaction.

### Account deletion
- D-10: The database transaction commits before the Auth0 user is deleted. If the Auth0 deletion fails, the server logs a structured error (user id, Auth0 sub) and the request still succeeds for the user; no new column, status or retry job (owner decision; research Open Question 3).

### Refinements after pattern mapping (Claude, within D-01..D-10)
- D-11: The `parcel_ids` format check must accept both synthetic cadastral IDs and the 14-character IGN `idu` the server stores in IGN mode (`surveys.service.ts:1124-1125`); derive the pattern from both producers, never reject an ID the server itself generated.
- D-12: Per-operation validation strips unknown fields (whitelist) but does not reject them (`forbidNonWhitelisted` off for `/sync` operations), so older clients and existing fixtures that send extra fields such as `location` keep working. Type/format violations on known fields are still fatal.
- D-13: D-04 compares values, not key presence: a read-only field of a submitted survey is rejected only when its value differs from the stored one. `scores` is recomputed by the server and is excluded from the comparison. The existing `patchSurvey` response (422 `submitted_read_only_fields`) is unchanged; the upsert path uses 409 `survey_submitted_read_only`.
- D-14: No `UNIQUE(parcel_id, version_number)` migration in this phase (existing production rows are not audited for duplicates). The sorted `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on parcels is the guard; a residual 23505 is still mapped to 409 as defence in depth.
- D-15: Once writes run on a transaction client, fault injection in E2E cannot spy on `DatabaseService.query`; use a spy on the transaction client or a temporary DB trigger on the events table in the `ibp_test` database. API unit specs stay in `api/test/` like the existing ones.

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact DTO class layout, helper naming, plan split and waves (plans touching `surveys.service.ts` must be sequenced), E2E file organisation. Coverage thresholds in `api/jest.unit.config.js` may only go up.

## Deferred Ideas

- Automatic retry of a failed Auth0 deletion (`pending_auth0_deletion` status + job) → only if logged failures show it is needed.
- Batched SQL for parcel linkage (lot L15) → later phase.
