# Phase 01.4: API sync integrity Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The server accepts only valid, correctly-sequenced sync operations and never commits half of a write.
**Verified:** 2026-09-24T22:02:49Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (Roadmap Success Criteria)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Every `POST /v1/sync` payload is validated by a class DTO; invalid payload → per-operation `fatal_error` with generic message; 22xxx/23xxx never retryable | ✓ VERIFIED | `sync-operation-validation.ts::validateSyncDto` runs `class-validator` per envelope/payload DTO (`SyncOperationEnvelopeDto`, `SurveyUpsertDto`, `CreateAttachmentDto`, etc.), whitelist strips unknown fields, throws generic `invalid_sync_operation` with only field names. `sync-error.utils.ts::mapSyncError` regex-matches SQLSTATE `^(22\|23)[0-9A-Z]{3}$` and always returns `fatal_error` with generic `invalid_operation`/"Operation could not be processed", never echoing raw pg text. `surveys-sync.service.ts::syncBatch` loops per-operation in try/catch so one bad op fails alone. Confirmed by `api/test/sync-error.utils.spec.ts`, `api/test/surveys-sync.service.spec.ts`, and E2E `api/test/sync-validation.e2e-spec.ts` (all pass, see below). |
| 2 | Sync upsert can't submit/move `expires_at`; client `status`/`expires_at` ignored; submitted read-only fields protected | ✓ VERIFIED | `surveys.service.ts::upsertForUser` computes `expiresAt` itself (`now + 7d`) and never reads `body.expires_at`; new surveys are always hardcoded `"draft"` regardless of `body.status`. `getChangedSubmittedReadOnlyFields` (surveys-normalize.utils.ts) does value-based comparison (excludes `scores`, ignores absent/undefined fields, set-equality for `parcel_ids`, deep-equal for `factors`) and any real change on a submitted survey throws `409 survey_submitted_read_only`. `SurveyUpsertDto` still accepts `status`/`expires_at` fields for backward-compat parsing but the service layer never consumes them. Confirmed by `api/test/surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts` and E2E `sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts` / `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts`. |
| 3 | Upsert/patch/submit/delete/attachment writes/report creation each run in one transaction with their event; injected event-insert failure leaves nothing committed; upsert UPDATE guarded on `sync_version` | ✓ VERIFIED | `DatabaseService.transaction()` (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK+rethrow/always release) wraps every write path: `upsertForUser`, `patchSurvey`, `patchSurveyVisibility`, `submitSurvey`, `deleteSurvey` in `surveys.service.ts`; `createAttachment`/`uploadAttachment`(confirm step)/`deleteAttachment` in `surveys-attachments.service.ts`; `createReport` in `reports.service.ts`; `deleteAccount` in `users.service.ts`. All UPDATE statements for guarded upsert use `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2 AND sync_version < $N`. Verified by `api/test/database.service.spec.ts` (unit), and E2E `database-transaction.e2e-spec.ts`, `surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` (5 distinct rollback tests: create/update/patch/submit/delete event-insert failures), `attachments-reports-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` — all pass live against PostgreSQL with injected failure triggers, confirming rollback via direct DB assertions. |
| 4 | Two concurrent submits on same parcel → one success + one 409, never 500/duplicate version; `parcel_ids` bounded/validated | ✓ VERIFIED | `submitSurvey` sorts and `FOR UPDATE` locks all affected `parcels` rows before resolving version, serializing concurrent submits; residual `23505` mapped to 409 as defense-in-depth. `SurveyUpsertDto.parcel_ids` uses `@ArrayMaxSize(MAX_PARCEL_IDS)` (=50) + `@Matches(PARCEL_ID_PATTERN)` (`/^[0-9A-Z]{1,32}$/i`, permissive per D-11 rationale for synthetic/IGN/reverse-geocoded IDs) on each element. Live E2E test `surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts::"gives exactly one winner for two concurrent submits..."` runs 5 iterations of `Promise.all` on two submits, asserts `[201, 409]` sorted statuses, asserts no 500, and asserts exactly 1 row with `status='submitted'` for that parcel/version in the DB — ran locally and passed. |
| 5 | Account deletion commits DB transaction before deleting the Auth0 user | ✓ VERIFIED | `users.service.ts::deleteAccount`: all local writes (anonymize retained surveys, delete draft surveys/events/attachments, delete user row) execute inside `this.db.transaction(...)`, which resolves/commits before `await this.auth0Management.deleteUser(...)` is called; Auth0 failure is caught and only logged, request still succeeds. Confirmed structurally in code and by `api/test/users.service.spec.ts` (mocked pool asserts commit-then-Auth0-call ordering and that Auth0 failure doesn't throw). |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| `SyncController.syncBatch` | `SurveysSyncService.syncBatch` | direct call | WIRED | `sync.controller.ts:19` |
| `SurveysSyncService.syncBatch` | `validateSyncDto` | per-operation call before delegating to service methods | WIRED | Confirmed for all 5 entity/action combos |
| `SurveysSyncService` catch block | `mapSyncError` | direct call, per operation | WIRED | `surveys-sync.service.ts:178` |
| `SurveysService.upsertForUser`/`submitSurvey`/etc. | `DatabaseService.transaction` | direct call wrapping all statements + `insertEvent` | WIRED | Confirmed for upsert (create+update+submitted-branch), patch, patchVisibility, submit, delete |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks / Test Execution

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Lint clean on changed files | `npm run lint` | 0 errors/warnings (mobile + api) | ✓ PASS |
| Typecheck clean | `npm run typecheck` | tsc build succeeds, no errors | ✓ PASS |
| Format check | `npm run format:check` | Only pre-existing `.claude/*` tooling files flagged (unrelated to phase); no phase source files flagged | ✓ PASS |
| Unit tests (API) | `npm run test:unit` (api workspace) | 14 suites / 153 tests passed, incl. `database.service.spec.ts`, `sync-error.utils.spec.ts`, `users.service.spec.ts`, `surveys-sync.service.spec.ts` (via other suite run), `surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts` | ✓ PASS |
| Unit tests (mobile) | `npm run test:unit` (mobile workspace) | 40 suites / 500 tests passed | ✓ PASS |
| E2E tests | `npm --workspace api run test:e2e` against local PostgreSQL 16 `ibp_test` | 12 suites / 77 tests passed, incl. `database-transaction.e2e-spec.ts`, `sync-validation.e2e-spec.ts`, `surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` (9 tests incl. concurrent-submit and 5 rollback scenarios), `attachments-reports-transactions.e2e-spec.ts`, `sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts` | ✓ PASS — matches CI evidence (`77 passed, 77 total`) recorded in `05-VALIDATION.md` |
| Concurrent-submit race test | inspected `surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` assertions directly | 5 loop iterations assert sorted `[201, 409]`, no 500, exactly 1 `submitted` row per parcel/version | ✓ PASS |

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. Grep for `TBD|FIXME|XXX|TODO|HACK|PLACEHOLDER|not yet implemented|coming soon` across all 10 phase-relevant source files returned zero matches. No empty stub implementations, no hardcoded empty returns feeding rendering/response paths found in the reviewed files.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|--------------|--------|----------|
| REQ-AUD-sync-validation | Plans 02, 05 | DTO validation, status/expires_at ignored, submitted read-only, parcel_ids bounded, deterministic DB errors fatal/generic | ✓ SATISFIED | Truths 1, 2, 4 above |
| REQ-AUD-transactions | Plans 01, 03, 04 | Every multi-statement write transactional with its event, guarded upsert, concurrent-submit resolution, account deletion ordering | ✓ SATISFIED | Truths 3, 4, 5 above |

No orphaned requirements found for Phase 01.4 in REQUIREMENTS.md.

### Human Verification Required

None outstanding — the one manual-only item (unchanged installed app syncing a draft with photo against the deployed API) is already recorded as approved by the owner in `05-VALIDATION.md` ("✅ 2026-09-24 owner approved after merge of #145"), with the CI evidence (PR #145, run 36064534242, second E2E run log quoted with `77 passed, 77 total` and rollback errors firing/being caught in the PostgreSQL service log) also present. This constitutes accepted human evidence per the escalation gate contract; no further human action is required to pass this phase.

### Gaps Summary

None. All 5 roadmap success criteria are independently verified against the actual code (not just SUMMARY claims): transaction wrapping, sync_version guard, sorted parcel lock, value-based read-only comparison, parcel_ids bound + pattern, deterministic-error redaction, and DB-before-Auth0 account deletion ordering were all read directly from source and confirmed by local execution of lint, typecheck, unit tests (153 API + 500 mobile), and the full E2E suite (77/77) against a real PostgreSQL 16 instance — reproducing the CI evidence recorded in VALIDATION.md.
