    - "E2E fault injection via a temporary, scoped PostgreSQL trigger on survey_events instead of spying on DatabaseService.query (required once writes run on a transaction client, D-15)"
    - "Post-commit best-effort external call: DB transaction commits first, external side effect (Auth0) is best-effort after, failures logged not thrown"

key-decisions:
  - "transaction() builds a small { query } adapter object over the PoolClient rather than exposing PoolClient directly, per D-06/D-15, so the same object type (Queryable) is usable both inside and outside a transaction and is easy for E2E specs to reason about"
  - "Fault injection uses a real PostgreSQL trigger (P0001) scoped to one survey_id (+ optional event_type) rather than a query spy, because DatabaseService.query cannot observe statements run on a transaction's dedicated client (D-15)"
  - "deleteAccount's Auth0 failure path swallows the error after logging (Logger.error with user_id + auth0_sub) so account deletion always succeeds for the user once the DB transaction has committed (D-10); no retry job added (explicitly deferred)"

patterns-established:
  - "Any future multi-statement write in surveys/attachments/reports services should use this.db.transaction(async (db) => ...) and thread db: Queryable through its private helpers, exactly as deleteAccount now does"

# Phase 01.4 Plan 01: Transaction primitive, fault-injection helper, and account-deletion ordering fix Summary

**`DatabaseService.transaction<T>(fn)` generalised from the deleteAccount BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK pattern, a reusable PostgreSQL-trigger-based E2E fault-injection helper for `survey_events`, and `deleteAccount` reordered so the DB transaction commits before Auth0 deletion (A-M9 fixed).**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 9 min (first commit 21:03:05Z, last task commit 21:11:23Z)
- **Started:** 2026-09-24T21:03:05Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-24T21:11:23Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 TDD, 1 non-TDD)
- **Files modified:** 6 (3 created, 3 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `DatabaseService.transaction<T>(fn: (db: Queryable) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>` runs `fn` on one dedicated pool client between `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, rolls back and rethrows the original error on any throw (even when `ROLLBACK` itself rejects), and always releases the client — proven with 5 unit specs against a mocked `pg` module.
- `export type Queryable` gives every future service a single query contract satisfied by both `DatabaseService` and the transaction adapter, so private helpers can thread `db: Queryable` through instead of always calling `this.db.query`.
- `installEventInsertFailure`/`removeEventInsertFailures` (`api/test/e2e-fault-injection.ts`) install/remove a scoped, temporary `BEFORE INSERT ON survey_events` trigger that raises `P0001` for one `survey_id` (and optionally one `event_type`) — the reusable building block plans 03/04 need to prove "an injected event-insert failure leaves nothing committed" against real PostgreSQL.
- `api/test/database-transaction.e2e-spec.ts` proves, against real PostgreSQL (`ibp_p01_test`): `transaction()` commits on success, rolls back everything on throw, and the fault-injection trigger fails only the targeted survey+event_type and is fully removable.
- `UsersService.deleteAccount` now runs the local account deletion inside `this.db.transaction(...)` and only calls `auth0Management.deleteUser` after that transaction has committed (A-M9). If the Auth0 call fails after commit, a structured `Logger.error` (user id + auth0_sub) is emitted and the request still resolves — no orphaned Auth0 account can ever be created by a DB failure, and no orphaned Auth0 user is left un-actionable on Auth0-side failure (D-10).

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (TDD tasks have a `test` RED commit followed by a `feat` GREEN commit):

1. **Task 1: Queryable type and DatabaseService.transaction helper with unit spec**
   - `0b29ed9` (test) — failing spec, pg mocked at module level
   - `0fbe7cd` (feat) — `Queryable` + `transaction<T>` implementation, all 5 specs green
2. **Task 2: E2E fault-injection helper and real-PostgreSQL proof of the helper**
   - `d721cc4` (feat) — `e2e-fault-injection.ts` + `database-transaction.e2e-spec.ts`, verified against `ibp_p01_test` (full E2E suite 57/57)
3. **Task 3: deleteAccount commits in the database before deleting the Auth0 user**
   - `ee27ad4` (test) — failing spec: transaction mock added to `buildService`, deleteAccount test renamed and extended with 3 new behaviour cases
   - `1d0ed31` (feat) — reordered `deleteAccount`, added `Logger`, all 26 users.service specs green, plus a prettier formatting pass on the two touched spec files

_No separate plan-metadata commit yet — that follows this SUMMARY per the execution protocol._

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/database/database.service.ts` — added `export type Queryable` and `async transaction<T>(fn)`; `query()`/`connect()` unchanged (DebugService still depends on `connect()`)
- `api/test/database.service.spec.ts` — new unit spec, mocks `pg` at module level (first such mock in the codebase), 5 cases covering commit/rollback/rollback-failure/begin-failure/handle-forwarding
- `api/test/e2e-fault-injection.ts` — new test-only module exporting `installEventInsertFailure`/`removeEventInsertFailures`; identifiers restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]` before being inlined into DDL (T-01.4-05)
- `api/test/database-transaction.e2e-spec.ts` — new E2E spec, production app via `configureApp`, 3 cases against real PostgreSQL
- `api/src/users/users.service.ts` — `deleteAccount` rewritten to use `this.db.transaction(...)`, added `private readonly logger = new Logger(UsersService.name)`, Auth0 deletion moved after commit and wrapped in try/catch with `logger.error` on failure
- `api/test/users.service.spec.ts` — `buildService`'s `db` mock gained a `transaction(fn)` implementation wrapping the same mock client; deleteAccount test renamed and extended with DB-failure, Auth0-failure, and missing-user cases

## Decisions Made

- Built a small `{ query }` adapter object over the `PoolClient` inside `transaction()` rather than exposing the `PoolClient` type directly — avoids `PoolClient`/`Queryable` overload-assignability friction and gives E2E specs one uniform object to reason about (per the plan's own guidance, D-06/D-15).
- Chose a real PostgreSQL trigger over a `jest.spyOn(db, "query")`-style spy for fault injection, because once writes run on a transaction's dedicated client, `DatabaseService.query` never sees them (D-15, confirmed in practice).
- Kept the Auth0-failure path silent-to-the-caller (log only, no rethrow, no new column/status/retry job) exactly per D-10 and the "Deferred Ideas" note in `05-CONTEXT.md` — a retry job was explicitly deferred, not implemented here.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. One incidental fix within Task 3's TDD GREEN step: the initial `buildService` transaction mock's `ROLLBACK` call needed `Promise.resolve(...)` wrapping so `.catch()` on a `jest.fn()`'s default `undefined` return didn't throw — a test-harness-only correction made while getting the DB-failure case green, not a deviation from the plan's scope.

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree had no `node_modules` for either workspace at start (mobile `tsc --noEmit` failed on missing packages like `expo-location`, `react-native-maps`). Ran `npm ci` at the worktree root per the parallel-execution setup instructions before any verification; typecheck and lint were clean afterward.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- `DatabaseService.transaction` and `Queryable` are ready for plans 03/04 to wrap surveys/attachments/reports writes.
- `installEventInsertFailure`/`removeEventInsertFailures` in `api/test/e2e-fault-injection.ts` are ready for reuse in those plans' own E2E specs (import path: `./e2e-fault-injection`).
- `deleteAccount` ordering (A-M9) is fixed and unit-tested; ROADMAP success criterion 5 is satisfied.
- Full verification green in this worktree: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run test:unit` (api 106/106, mobile 500/500), and `npm --workspace api run test:e2e` against `ibp_p01_test` (57/57, baseline 54 + 3 new).
