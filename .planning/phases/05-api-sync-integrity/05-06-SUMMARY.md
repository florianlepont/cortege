# Phase 01.4 Plan 06: Phase gate Summary

**The integrated phase passed the local gate and a fully green CI run on PR #145. The owner merged it and confirmed that an unchanged installed app still syncs a draft with a photo and submits it against the deployed API.**

## Accomplishments

- **Local gate:** lint, typecheck and format pass. Unit tests pass for the API (153, with coverage) and for mobile (500). E2E passed 77/77, run twice against PostgreSQL 16 with the CI environment. The coverage ratchet check printed `ratchet ok`.
- **PR CI:** PR https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/pull/145, run https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36064534242.
  - Every job passed, and E2E ran twice on the same database with the reset asserted.
  - The PostgreSQL service log shows the injected failures firing.
- **Main build:** run https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36064735451 passed and pushed the image.
- **Owner device check:** approved.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **E2E ran locally rather than being deferred to CI.** The orchestrator started the sandbox PostgreSQL cluster and gave each parallel executor its own `*_test` database. Every plan's E2E therefore ran locally, and CI confirmed the results.
2. **The owner merged PR #145 as soon as its CI passed, before the evidence was written up.** The evidence was then recorded from the finished run, on a follow-up branch.

## Issues Encountered

None.
