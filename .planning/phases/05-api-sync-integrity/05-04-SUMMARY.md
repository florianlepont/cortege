  patterns:
    - "SurveysAttachmentsService private helpers (getSurveyForUser, getSurveyForUserOrThrow, insertEvent) take db: Queryable first, same shape as plan 01/03's transaction pattern"
    - "getSurveyForUser gains an optional forUpdate flag appending 'FOR UPDATE' so ownership-check + COUNT + INSERT serialise on the survey row inside one transaction"
    - "Post-commit best-effort storage cleanup: cleanupAttachmentStorage(existing.storage_key) now runs only after db.transaction resolves in deleteAttachment (D-07)"

key-decisions:
  - "createAttachment keeps body validation (mime_type/size_bytes/allowed type) and the id/storage-key/presign computation before the transaction (no DB access); ownership check (FOR UPDATE), COUNT and INSERT+event move inside this.db.transaction so two concurrent creates on the same survey serialise and cannot both pass the 10-attachment check"
  - "uploadAttachment keeps the token check, ownership check, attachment SELECT and the (non-transactional) file write outside/before the transaction; only the UPDATE uploaded_at + attachment_uploaded event run inside one db.transaction"
  - "deleteAttachment runs UPDATE deleted_at + attachment_deleted event inside one transaction, then calls cleanupAttachmentStorage only after it resolves (D-07); the allowMissing early-return path performs no writes and is unaffected"
  - "ReportsService.createReport wraps the reports INSERT and the 'reported' survey_events INSERT in one db.transaction; input/reportability checks stay outside since they are pure reads/validation"

# Phase 01.4 Plan 04: Transactions for attachment and report writes Summary

**Attachment create/upload-confirm/delete and report creation each now run atomically with their survey_events insert; the 10-attachment limit is race-free via a `FOR UPDATE` survey-row lock, and object-storage cleanup stays post-commit best-effort.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 21 min (first commit 21:15:56Z approx, last task commit 21:23:xxZ)
- **Tasks:** 2 (both non-TDD `auto`)
- **Files modified:** 3 (1 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `SurveysAttachmentsService`: `getSurveyForUser`, `getSurveyForUserOrThrow` and `insertEvent` now take `db: Queryable` first; `getSurveyForUser` gained an optional `forUpdate` flag.
- `createAttachment`: body validation and id/storage-key/presign computation stay outside the transaction (no DB); ownership check (`FOR UPDATE`), the active-attachment `COUNT`, and the `INSERT` + `attachment_created` event now run inside one `this.db.transaction(...)`, closing the create/count race (T-01.4-18).
- `uploadAttachment`: the `UPDATE ... uploaded_at` and the `attachment_uploaded` event insert run in one transaction; the non-transactional file write to disk/S3 stays before it, as required.
- `deleteAttachment`: `UPDATE ... deleted_at` and the `attachment_deleted` event insert run in one transaction; `cleanupAttachmentStorage` now runs only after that transaction resolves (D-07, T-01.4-19) instead of between the UPDATE and the event insert.
- `ReportsService.createReport`: the `reports` INSERT and the `'reported'` `survey_events` INSERT now run in one `this.db.transaction(...)`.
- New E2E spec `api/test/attachments-reports-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` (6 cases) proves, against real PostgreSQL (`ibp_p04_test`), that an injected failure on `attachment_created` (both REST and `/v1/sync` `attachment.create`, including retryable_error + successful retry after removing the fault), `attachment_uploaded`, `attachment_deleted`, and `reported` leaves nothing committed; a separate case proves 9 sequential + 3 concurrent attachment creates land at exactly 10 active attachments with the other two rejected 400.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Transactions in SurveysAttachmentsService and ReportsService** — `4d5dae6` (feat)
2. **Task 2: E2E — injected event failures on attachments and reports** — `8469e41` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts` — private helpers threaded with `db: Queryable`; `createAttachment`/`uploadAttachment`/`deleteAttachment` wrap their writes in `this.db.transaction(...)`; storage cleanup moved after the delete transaction
- `api/src/reports/reports.service.ts` — `createReport`'s report INSERT + `reported` event INSERT wrapped in `this.db.transaction(...)`
- `api/test/attachments-reports-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` — new E2E spec, 6 cases

## Decisions Made

See `key-decisions` in frontmatter. No decisions outside the plan's own guidance or Claude's discretion per `05-CONTEXT.md`.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All `must_haves` truths and artifacts from the plan frontmatter are implemented and verified by lint, typecheck, unit tests and the new/full E2E suite.

## Issues Encountered

- Worktree required `git reset --hard` to fast-forward from `dad66f1` (its prior HEAD, an ancestor) to the expected wave-1 base `4cc158b` before any edits, per the `worktree_branch_check` protocol.
- `node_modules` for both workspaces was missing at start; ran `npm ci` at the worktree root before the first `typecheck`/`lint` run, per the parallel-execution instructions.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- `surveys.service.ts` was not touched (owned by plan 03, running in parallel on a disjoint file set); no conflict.
- ROADMAP success criterion 3 ("attachment writes and report creation" run atomically with their events) is satisfied and proven with real-PostgreSQL fault injection.
- Full verification green in this worktree: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm --workspace api run test:unit` (138/138), `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` (500/500), and `npm --workspace api run test:e2e` against `ibp_p04_test` (68/68, baseline 62 + 6 new).
