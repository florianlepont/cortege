  - "Removed the explicit generic parameter on this.db.transaction<SubmitOutcome>(...) in submitSurvey in favour of an outer `const outcome: SubmitOutcome = await this.db.transaction(...)` annotation, so every write path still matches the plan's grep-verifiable `this.db.transaction(` call shape"
  - "In upsertForUser, the concurrent-create race check reuses getSurveyForUser(db, id, user.id, false, { forUpdate: true }) filtered by user_id: if it returns null after an ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING miss, the row is known to exist (from the conflict) but is not owned by the caller, so a 409 survey_id_conflict is thrown without a separate ownership query"

patterns-established:
  - "Any future SurveysService write path should follow the same shape: return this.db.transaction(async (db) => { ...all statements on db... }), with private helpers threading db: Queryable, and post-commit side effects collected inside the callback and executed after transaction() resolves"

# Phase 01.4 Plan 03: Transaction integrity and submit concurrency for SurveysService Summary

**Every SurveysService write path (upsert/patch/patchVisibility/submit/delete) now runs atomically with its survey_events insert inside `DatabaseService.transaction`, the upsert is guarded on `sync_version` with a race-safe `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`, and concurrent submits on the same parcel are serialised by a sorted `FOR UPDATE` lock so exactly one succeeds and the other gets a 409.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 42 min (first commit 21:28:36Z, last task commit 21:34:04Z, plus prior reading/setup)
- **Started:** 2026-09-24T20:52:00Z (worktree base reset + reading)
- **Completed:** 2026-09-24T21:34:04Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2 (1 modified, 1 created)

## Accomplishments

- `upsertForUser`, `patchSurvey`, `patchSurveyVisibility`, `submitSurvey` and `deleteSurvey` each run their full body inside `this.db.transaction(async (db) => ...)`; every private helper they call (`getSurveyForUser(OrThrow)`, `insertEvent`, `getSurveyParcelIds`, `syncSurveyParcels`, `ensureParcelIds`/`ensureParcelById`, `getDefaultVersionNumber`, `validateParcelSubmit`) now takes `db: Queryable` as its first parameter; the two remaining read-only call sites (`getSurveyById`, `getEvents`) pass `this.db` explicitly.
- Upsert create uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING RETURNING id, updated_at::text`; when a concurrent create wins the race, the survey is re-read under `FOR UPDATE` and either falls through to the existing-row (update) path for the same user, or is rejected with 409 `survey_id_conflict` if owned by someone else (T-01.4-15). The upsert UPDATE is guarded with `AND sync_version < $17`; a zero-row update re-reads the row and returns the idempotent result if the client replayed the same `sync_version`, or a fresh `sync_version_conflict` 409 otherwise (T-01.4-11).
- `submitSurvey` locks the survey row `FOR UPDATE`, then locks its parcels with `SELECT parcel_id FROM parcels WHERE parcel_id = ANY($1) ORDER BY parcel_id FOR UPDATE` (sorted, to avoid deadlocks) before resolving the expected version number — so two concurrent submits on the same parcel/version serialise to one 201 and one 409 `parcel_version_conflict`, never a 500 (D-08). A residual `23505` is still mapped to the same 409 as defence in depth (D-14). The "expired" status write is persisted via a discriminated transaction outcome (`{ kind: "rejected", error }`) so it survives even though the overall submit is rejected and the transaction otherwise commits normally.
- `deleteSurvey`'s attachment/survey updates and its `deleted` event now commit together; object-storage cleanup (`cleanupAttachmentStorage`) runs only after the transaction resolves, best-effort (D-07).
- Removed the two A-M1 error-swallowing `catch` blocks in `getSurveyParcelIds`/`syncSurveyParcels` so a real parcel-linkage failure now aborts the transaction instead of silently returning (D-09).
- New `api/test/surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` proves, against real PostgreSQL: injected-failure rollback for upsert-create, upsert-update (with a replay-heals-after-removal case), patch, submit and delete; one-winner concurrent submits (looped 5x on fresh parcels, confirmed non-flaky across 3 additional runs = 15 total iterations); a concurrent same-`sync_version` upsert that never 500s and converges on one `updated` event; and an expired submit that persists `status='expired'` plus its `expired` event.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Thread Queryable through SurveysService and wrap every write path in one transaction** - `0b0e0fb` (feat)
2. **Task 2: E2E — injected event failure, concurrent submit, concurrent upsert** - `894f2cc` (test)

_Plan-metadata commit follows this SUMMARY per the execution protocol._

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts` - `upsertForUser`/`patchSurvey`/`patchSurveyVisibility`/`submitSurvey`/`deleteSurvey` wrapped in `this.db.transaction`; nine private helpers threaded with `db: Queryable`; two new private helpers (`resolveSelectedParcelIds`, `resolveVersionInfo`) extracted to share upsert's parcel/version-resolution logic between the create and existing-row paths without duplicating it; A-M1 catches removed
- `api/test/surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` - new E2E spec, 8 cases, production app via `configureApp`, using `installEventInsertFailure`/`removeEventInsertFailures` from plan 01

## Decisions Made

See `key-decisions` in frontmatter. Notably: the `SubmitOutcome` generic was moved from `this.db.transaction<SubmitOutcome>(...)` to an outer type annotation so the plan's acceptance-criteria grep (`this.db.transaction(` count ≥ 5) still matches all five call sites literally.

## Deviations from Plan

None outside Claude's discretion. Two implementation adjustments made while getting the code to typecheck and match the plan's own grep-verifiable acceptance criteria (not scope changes):

1. Captured `syncVersion`/`siteName` as local `const`s in `upsertForUser` immediately after their existing validation throws, because TypeScript does not retain narrowing of an optional property read through `body.sync_version`/`body.site_name` across the `this.db.transaction(async (db) => ...)` closure boundary. Purely a type-narrowing fix; the guarded values and runtime behavior are unchanged.
2. Dropped the explicit `<SubmitOutcome>` generic argument on `this.db.transaction` in `submitSurvey`, replacing it with `const outcome: SubmitOutcome = await this.db.transaction(...)`, so the literal string `this.db.transaction(` still appears at all five call sites (a generic argument between `transaction` and `(` would have broken the plan's own `grep -c "this.db.transaction("` acceptance check).

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree had no `node_modules` installed (root and per-workspace) at the start of Task 1; ran `npm ci` at the worktree root before the first `typecheck`/`lint` run, per the parallel-execution instructions. (The very first typecheck/lint/unit-test pass had accidentally been run from the outer repo checkout instead of the worktree — caught and corrected before trusting any green result.)
- `POST /v1/surveys/:id/attachments` returns `attachment_id`, not `id`; the delete-rollback E2E case initially asserted on the wrong field name and was corrected before the suite passed.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- `surveys.service.ts` public method signatures are unchanged; plan 04 (attachments/reports transactions) and plan 05 (upsert `status`/`expires_at` read-only handling) can build directly on top of this transaction shape without further refactoring of the methods this plan touched.
- No new migration was added (`ls api/migrations` unchanged, per D-14); the sorted `FOR UPDATE` lock remains the primary concurrency guard for submit, with `23505` mapped to 409 as defence in depth.
- Full verification green in this worktree: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm --workspace api run test:unit` (138/138), and `npm --workspace api run test:e2e` against `ibp_p03_test` (70/70 = 62 baseline + 8 new). The concurrent-submit case was re-run 3 additional times (15 total iterations across parcels) with no flakiness.
