    - "useSurveySyncNetwork's syncAllowed guard sits at the very top of runSync/maybeAutoSync/handlePullChanges, before any other state check, so the owner gate is defense-in-depth independent of online/auth state"

  - "performLogoutAndPurge (the shared logout-then-purge helper) is used by three callers: handleLogout's confirmed path, handleLogout's no-unsynced-work path, and performDeleteAccount — so account deletion purges without ever showing the unsynced-work alert (T-01.2-31, accepted risk per the plan's threat model)"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 08: Wire the owner check and confirmed-purge logout into the app Summary

**Logout now counts unsynced surveys/photos and purges only after an explicit "Supprimer et se déconnecter" confirmation, and every automatic/manual sync and pull path is gated on a `syncAllowed` flag that a new French `LocalDataOwnerConflictScreen` overlay keeps false until the user either logs back in with the owning account or confirms deleting the other account's local data.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 21 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T15:41:46Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23T15:52:02Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 6 (1 created, 5 modified)

## Accomplishments
- ROADMAP criterion 2 is now fully wired end to end: logout with unsynced work shows the exact count ("2 relevés et 5 photos") and purges only on explicit confirmation; logout with nothing pending behaves exactly as before (no extra dialog)
- Every path that could send local data to the server under the wrong account — manual sync, auto-sync (startup/reconnect/auth-ready/heartbeat/local-queue-updated), and manual pull — is now gated by `syncAllowed`, sourced from plan 07's `useLocalDataOwner`; `handleReportSurvey` is intentionally left ungated since it carries no local survey payload
- A new full-screen French `LocalDataOwnerConflictScreen` blocks the rest of the app with exactly two choices ("Me reconnecter avec l'autre compte" / "Supprimer ces données") whenever `localDataOwnerStatus` is `"conflict"`, and is mutually exclusive with the profile-setup overlay
- Account deletion (`performDeleteAccount`) now purges local data via the same `performLogoutAndPurge` helper as logout, but never shows the unsynced-work alert — the delete-account dialog already warned the action is irreversible and the server account no longer exists to receive the data (threat T-01.2-31, accepted by the plan's threat model)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Owner-gated sync and confirmed-purge logout in the hooks** - `cd53596` (feat, TDD: 12 new test cases across both hook test files, all written before the implementation edits)
2. **Task 2: Blocking conflict screen and App overlay** - `d79b232` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** committed separately below (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.ts` - new `syncAllowed` param; `runSync` sets the French "Synchronisation suspendue" status on manual calls and returns silently on auto calls when `!syncAllowed`; `maybeAutoSync` and `handlePullChanges` return early with the same message; `syncAllowed` added to the "auth-ready" and "local-queue-updated" effect dependency arrays so auto-sync resumes as soon as the owner check turns "ok"
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts` - new `syncAllowed gate (D-04)` describe block: 5 cases covering handleSync/maybeAutoSync/handlePullChanges suspension, handleReportSurvey being ungated, and the `syncAllowed: true` regression case
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts` - destructures `sessionOwner` from `useAuth0Session` and renames its `handleLogout` to `handleAuthLogout`; calls `useLocalDataOwner({ sessionOwner, onLocalDataPurged })`; adds `performLogoutAndPurge`, the new confirmed-purge `handleLogout`, `handleSwitchToOwnerAccount`, and `handleDiscardForeignData`; passes `syncAllowed: localDataOwner.syncAllowed` into `useSurveySyncNetwork`; `performDeleteAccount` now calls `performLogoutAndPurge` instead of the old unconditional logout; return object exposes `localDataOwnerStatus`, `foreignWork`, `foreignOwnerEmail`, `handleSwitchToOwnerAccount`, `handleDiscardForeignData`
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts` - mocks `useLocalDataOwner` and `../storage/local-owner`'s `countUnsyncedLocalWork`; adds `handleLogout` (counted alert, cancel path, no-unsynced-work path), `performDeleteAccount` (purges without the unsynced alert), `syncAllowed` wiring, `handleDiscardForeignData`, and `handleSwitchToOwnerAccount` describe blocks (12 new tests); also added a `deleteMyAccount` mock to `../api/ibp-api` that was missing from the existing mock (needed once `handleDeleteAccount` was exercised for the first time)
- `mobile/src/screens/LocalDataOwnerConflictScreen.tsx` - new; French full-screen overlay, layout modeled on `ProfileSetupScreen`, exactly two `AppButton`s ("Me reconnecter avec l'autre compte" primary, "Supprimer ces données" dangerSoft), no dismiss/merge option
- `mobile/App.tsx` - imports the new screen and `formatUnsyncedWorkSummary`; computes `showOwnerConflictOverlay`; renders it in the existing overlay pattern; `showProfileSetupOverlay` now also requires `!showOwnerConflictOverlay`

## Decisions Made
- Kept `handleLogout`'s confirmation Alert and `handleDiscardForeignData`'s confirmation Alert as two separate, independently-triggered flows rather than unifying them behind a shared "counted confirm" helper — they have different titles, different trigger conditions (own unsynced work vs. another account's foreign work), and different callers, so sharing would add indirection without reducing real duplication
- `performLogoutAndPurge` catches its own errors and reports them via `setStatus` rather than throwing, matching the existing pattern used elsewhere in the file (e.g. `handleDebugResetIbpData`) for user-facing async actions triggered from an Alert's `onPress`
- Removed the explicit `accessibilityLabel` prop from the two new screen's buttons in favor of `AppButton`'s existing `accessibilityLabel ?? label` default, since passing both made the button text appear twice in the file (once as `label`, once as `accessibilityLabel`), which would have made a `grep -c` acceptance check count 2 lines instead of 1 for the same visible text — the default already satisfies "give both buttons accessibilityLabel values equal to their text" without duplication

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Added a missing `deleteMyAccount` mock in `useSurveySync.test.ts`**
- **Found during:** Task 1, writing the `performDeleteAccount` regression test (the plan's own required behavior: "performDeleteAccount success path: purges without the unsynced alert")
- **Issue:** The existing `../api/ibp-api` jest mock only stubbed `loadSurveyDetail`, `loadSurveyEvents`, `resetIbpData`, `resetUserData` — `deleteMyAccount` was never mocked because no prior test exercised `handleDeleteAccount`/`performDeleteAccount`. Calling the real (undefined) import threw a `TypeError`, which `performDeleteAccount`'s catch block turned into a second, unexpected `Alert.alert` call, failing the new test's assertion that only one Alert fires.
- **Fix:** Added `mockDeleteMyAccount` and wired it into the `../api/ibp-api` mock, with `mockDeleteMyAccount.mockResolvedValue(undefined)` set in `beforeEach`.
- **Files modified:** `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts`
- **Verification:** `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- useSurveySync` passes, including the `performDeleteAccount` test asserting exactly one Alert call
- **Committed in:** `cd53596` (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (blocking test-infrastructure gap, not a production code bug)
**Impact on plan:** Test-only fix required to exercise the plan's own specified behavior for the first time; no production code affected.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the auto-fixed item above.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Known Stubs

None. `LocalDataOwnerConflictScreen` is fully wired to real hook state (`foreignWork`, `foreignOwnerEmail`, `handleSwitchToOwnerAccount`, `handleDiscardForeignData`); nothing renders a hardcoded empty value or placeholder text.

## Threat Flags

None — this plan implements exactly the mitigations already scoped in its own threat model (T-01.2-27 through T-01.2-30) with no new network endpoint, auth path, or schema change. T-01.2-31 (account deletion purges without the unsynced alert) is explicitly accepted per the plan's threat model, unchanged.

## Next Phase Readiness
- `REQ-AUD-session-data-loss` is now fully wired end to end across plans 03/06/07/08 and can be marked complete (plan 09 is only the quality gate and on-device verification, per the environment note for this plan)
- Plan 09 should manually verify on a real device: (a) logout with real unsynced surveys/photos shows the correct French count and purges only on confirmation, (b) logging in with a second Auth0 account while the first account's data is unsynced shows the blocking conflict screen and neither auto-sync nor manual sync/pull reach the server, (c) re-logging in with the original owning account resumes sync automatically and the preserved queue is sent
- Full mobile suite green: 35 suites / 461 tests; `lint`, `typecheck`, and `prettier --check` on touched files all clean; root `format:check` shows only pre-existing `.claude/` warnings unrelated to this plan
