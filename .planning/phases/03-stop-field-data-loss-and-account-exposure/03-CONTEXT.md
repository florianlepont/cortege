# Phase 01.2: Stop field data loss and account exposure - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-09-23
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Owner decisions taken during `/gsd:plan-phase 1.2` (no discuss-phase run), plus the audit decisions recorded in `.planning/PROJECT.md` → Key Decisions

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Audit lots L1–L4 (`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md`): a session error never destroys offline data; logout is explicit about unsynced work; rate limiting, the debug surface, account linking and report privacy stop exposing accounts; dev tools leave production builds; the nearby-parcels bbox is fixed; pre-Auth0 session stubs are removed. Nothing in this phase may break the mobile apps already installed.

## Implementation Decisions

### Session errors (REQ-AUD-session-data-loss)
- D-01: Classify `CredentialsManagerError.type` from `react-native-auth0@5.4.1`. Only `RENEW_FAILED` and `NO_REFRESH_TOKEN` (and `NO_CREDENTIALS` at restore) end the session. `NO_NETWORK`, timeouts and every other type mean "retry later": the session and all local data stay.
- D-01a (refinement recorded during planning, 2026-09-23): `RENEW_FAILED` ends the session **only when the device is online**. The installed SDK maps iOS `renewFailed` to `RENEW_FAILED` and has no separate iOS network code, so a network failure during refresh would otherwise log the user out — contradicting ROADMAP criterion 1. `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` is "retry later", as D-01 states. Implemented and unit-tested in plan 01.2-03; to be confirmed on a real device in plan 01.2-09.
- D-02: Ending a session never purges local data. `clearLocalIbpData()` leaves the session-cleared path entirely.

### Logout (REQ-AUD-session-data-loss)
- D-03: Logout with unsynced surveys or photos shows how many will be lost and purges only after explicit confirmation. Logout with nothing pending behaves as today.

### Local data owned by another account (REQ-AUD-session-data-loss)
- D-04: Store the owning Auth0 `sub` in `local_meta` (e.g. key `session_owner_sub`). After a login, if unsynced local data belongs to a different `sub`, **sync stays suspended** and the app states that N surveys belong to another account, offering exactly two choices: log back in with that account, or delete them after confirmation. Nothing is ever sent under the wrong account. No merge.

### Rate limiting (REQ-AUD-rate-limit)
- D-05: The global `ThrottlerGuard` runs before `AuthGuard`, so `req.user` is not available. Tracker key = SHA-256 of the Bearer token when present, otherwise the real client IP. The API is created as `NestExpressApplication` with `app.set("trust proxy", "loopback")`. Guard order is not changed. The JWT is never decoded without verification for tracking.
- D-06: Raise the production default well above 10/min and put tighter `@Throttle` limits only on costly routes (`/sync`, uploads). Exact values are Claude's discretion, sized so one device syncing a full offline day stays under them.

### Debug surface (REQ-AUD-debug-surface)
- D-07: `DebugModule` and the HS256 test-token path load only when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`. CI already runs E2E with `NODE_ENV=test`, which must keep working.

### Identity and reports (REQ-AUD-identity)
- D-08: Email-based account linking is **kept** but requires `email_verified === true` from Auth0 `/userinfo` (Google/Apple social login depends on it — `REQ-A-social-login`).
- D-09: First-login provisioning is race-free using the existing UNIQUE constraint on `users.auth0_sub` (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT`).
- D-10: The `reported` survey event no longer carries `actor_id` or `reason`; a migration scrubs existing rows. The `reports` table keeps them. Report `reason` gets a maximum length.

### Mobile quick fixes (REQ-AUD-mobile-quick-fixes)
- D-11: Dev tools (API URL override, data resets) render only in `__DEV__` builds, via a small extracted helper that a `*.test.ts` can cover (`.test.tsx` is not collected until Phase 1.3).
- D-12: Nearby-parcels bbox uses `minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat`, sharing the helper in `mobile/src/app/map-viewport.ts`.

### Test tooling
- D-13: Install `@testing-library/react-native` and `test-renderer` as dev dependencies **of the `mobile` workspace only** (`npm install --workspace mobile --save-dev …`); commit the lockfile. Phase 1.3 generalises `renderHook`; this phase uses it only for its own regression tests.

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact throttle values, `local_meta` key names, wording of the French confirmation dialogs (the UI is French), file layout of new helpers and tests.

## Deferred Ideas

None — everything else from the audit is in Phases 1.3–1.9.
