  patterns:
    - "Storage-layer unit tests mock ./db's getDb() with a fake db object exposing jest.fn() runAsync/getFirstAsync, then assert on SQL text + params — no real SQLite involved (Phase 1.3 concern)"
    - "renderHook test afterEach MUST `await cleanup()` (not fire-and-forget `cleanup()`) — the fire-and-forget form used elsewhere in this codebase races the next test's mount against the previous test's async unmount and cross-contaminates hook state under jest --runInBand; documented inline in useLocalDataOwner.test.ts"
    - "Hooks needing 'is this async check about a stale prop' guard use a ref updated unconditionally each render (sessionOwnerRef) instead of comparing prop identity, so recheck() always reads the truly current session even mid-flight"

key-decisions:
  - "Owner marker keys are session_owner_sub / session_owner_email in local_meta (D-04 discretion), upserted with the same ON CONFLICT statement sync.ts uses, implemented locally in local-owner.ts to avoid a sync.ts <-> surveys.ts import cycle"
  - "syncAllowed is strictly `status === \"ok\"` — idle, checking, conflict and error all suspend sync (default-deny per D-04)"
  - "discardForeignData is a separate exported function, never called by the hook's own effect; plan 08 wires it to a confirmation dialog after the user explicitly chooses to delete another account's data"
  - "recheck() guards against a stale in-flight check applying its decision after sessionOwner changed again mid-await, using a ref comparison before committing state"

patterns-established:
  - "The D-04 decision table (adopt/match/purge-and-adopt/conflict/unknown-session) is implemented as a single pure function with one test per table row, kept separate from storage and React — plan 08 and any future consumer can reuse resolveLocalDataOwnership without touching SQLite or hooks"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 07: Local data ownership mechanism (D-04 building blocks) Summary

**Pure D-04 ownership decision table, `local_meta`-backed owner persistence with unsynced-work counting, and a `useLocalDataOwner` hook whose `syncAllowed` flag is false by default and only ever true when the logged-in Auth0 account matches the account that owns the device's unsynced surveys/photos — nothing wired into the app yet (plan 08).**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 10 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T15:29:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23T15:38:37Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 8 (6 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments
- The D-04 decision table (`adopt`, `match`, `purge-and-adopt`, `conflict`, `unknown-session`) exists as a single pure, fully-tested function (`resolveLocalDataOwnership`) — 16 tests, one per table row plus edge cases
- `local_meta` now persists which Auth0 `sub`/`email` owns the device's local data, and `countUnsyncedLocalWork()` can count pending/failed/blocked surveys and non-synced attachments for the confirmation dialogs plan 08 will show
- `clearLocalIbpData()` (used by both explicit logout-purge and the owner hook's purge-and-adopt path) now also forgets the owner marker, so a fresh purge never leaves a stale owner behind
- `useLocalDataOwner` gives the app a single `syncAllowed` boolean that is false unless the current session's account is confirmed to own the local data — conflict state never purges or adopts on its own; `discardForeignData()` is the only path that can, and it must be called explicitly

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (TDD: test/RED then feat/GREEN per task):

1. **Task 1: Ownership decision, unsynced-work summary and owner storage** - `fdc3f82` (test, RED: local-data-owner) → `01f6e5b` (feat, GREEN: local-data-owner + local-owner + surveys.ts + storage.ts barrel); storage helper tests were RED separately at `5680275`, folded into the same GREEN commit
2. **Task 2: useLocalDataOwner hook with a default-deny syncAllowed flag** - `b2ad6bf` (test, RED) → `d9ade18` (feat, GREEN)

**Plan metadata:** committed separately below (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/app/local-data-owner.ts` - `resolveLocalDataOwnership`, `hasUnsyncedWork`, `formatUnsyncedWorkSummary` (French: "1 relevé", "2 relevés et 5 photos", "aucune donnée")
- `mobile/src/app/local-data-owner.test.ts` - 16 tests, one per decision-table row plus format/hasUnsyncedWork cases
- `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.ts` - `getLocalDataOwner`, `setLocalDataOwner`, `countUnsyncedLocalWork`, `LOCAL_OWNER_SUB_KEY`/`LOCAL_OWNER_EMAIL_KEY`; imports only `./db`, no cycle with `./sync`
- `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.test.ts` - 7 tests mocking `./db`'s `getDb()`, asserting SQL text and bound params
- `mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts` - `clearLocalIbpData` now also deletes the two owner keys from `local_meta`
- `mobile/src/storage.ts` - barrel re-exports `./storage/local-owner`
- `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts` - `useLocalDataOwner({ sessionOwner, onLocalDataPurged })` returning `{ status, syncAllowed, foreignWork, foreignOwnerEmail, discardForeignData, recheck }`; no network access, no UI
- `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.test.ts` - 8 renderHook tests covering every behavior case from the plan

## Decisions Made
- Key names (`session_owner_sub`, `session_owner_email`) and French summary wording were Claude's discretion per CONTEXT — kept simple and consistent with existing app tone
- `setLocalDataOwner`'s "match" path only re-writes `local_meta` when the stored email differs from the session's, avoiding an unnecessary write on every login with the same account
- `recheck()` compares `sessionOwnerRef.current?.sub` against the sub captured at call start before committing any decision, so a session change that happens while `getLocalDataOwner()`/`countUnsyncedLocalWork()` are in flight cannot apply a stale result

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed a test-pollution race in the renderHook `afterEach` cleanup**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (useLocalDataOwner hook tests) — `discardForeignData` and the sessionOwner-changes-to-null tests failed only when run after certain other tests in the same file, never in isolation
- **Issue:** The codebase's established renderHook pattern (`afterEach(() => { cleanup() })`, used as-is in `render-hook-smoke.test.ts` and `useAuth0Session.test.ts`) does not await `cleanup()`, which is async. Under `jest --runInBand`, the previous test's unmount could still be in flight when the next test's `renderHook()` mounted, corrupting `result.current` state across the boundary.
- **Fix:** In `useLocalDataOwner.test.ts` only, changed to `afterEach(async () => { await cleanup() })`, with a comment explaining why. Scoped to this new file — did not touch the other two files using the older pattern, since they are out of this plan's file list and were not observed to fail (no drive-by fix, Rule 1 is about correctness of code this plan touches).
- **Files modified:** `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.test.ts`
- **Verification:** All 8 tests pass individually, in combination, and as part of the full 35-suite/449-test mobile unit run
- **Committed in:** `b2ad6bf` (Task 2 RED commit, since the fix was made before the tests were observed green)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Removed an initially-missed `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` lint suppression need**
- **Found during:** Task 2, running `npm --workspace mobile run lint` after the GREEN implementation
- **Issue:** The mount/session-change `useEffect` legitimately needs to react only to `sessionOwner?.sub` (not the whole object, since `recheck()` reads the current session via a ref) but ESLint's exhaustive-deps rule flagged the missing `sessionOwner` dependency
- **Fix:** Added a scoped `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` with a comment explaining that `recheck` already reads the latest `sessionOwner` via `sessionOwnerRef`, so depending on the full object would cause unnecessary re-checks on unrelated object-identity churn
- **Files modified:** `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts`
- **Verification:** `npm --workspace mobile run lint` exits clean (0 problems)
- **Committed in:** `d9ade18` (Task 2 GREEN commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (2 bugs found while making the plan's own tests pass reliably)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes are internal to the new test/hook files this plan created; no existing behavior changed. No scope creep — the plan's other renderHook test files were left untouched.

## Issues Encountered
None beyond the two auto-fixed items above.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Known Stubs

None. `useLocalDataOwner` is fully wired to real storage functions (mocked only in tests); nothing renders a hardcoded empty value or placeholder text.

## Threat Flags

None — this plan implements exactly the mitigation the threat model already scoped (T-01.2-24, T-01.2-25) with no new network endpoint, auth path, or schema change. T-01.2-26 (rooted-device tampering with `local_meta`) is explicitly accepted per the plan's threat model, unchanged.

## Requirement Tracking Note

`REQ-AUD-session-data-loss` is intentionally **not** marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md by this plan, per the environment instructions and the plan's own scope: this plan builds the owner-check mechanism in isolation (pure module + storage + hook, all unit-tested) but does not wire it into `useSurveySync`, the app's logout flow, or any UI. Plan 08 does that wiring and is the one that closes the requirement.

## Next Phase Readiness
- `resolveLocalDataOwnership`, `getLocalDataOwner`/`setLocalDataOwner`/`countUnsyncedLocalWork`, and `useLocalDataOwner` are all ready for plan 08 to consume directly
- Plan 08 still needs to: call `useLocalDataOwner` from the app's session/sync orchestration, gate the actual sync call on `syncAllowed`, build the French confirmation dialog for `discardForeignData` (using `formatUnsyncedWorkSummary`), and build the logout confirm-and-count flow (D-03) — neither of which this plan touches
- No blockers identified for plan 08
