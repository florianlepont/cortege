# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.2-01
    provides: API rate limiting (tracker key, per-client + per-IP ceilings)
  - phase: 01.2-02
    provides: Identity/email-verification linking and reporter-identity redaction
  - phase: 01.2-05
    provides: Debug surface gating in production
  - phase: 01.2-08
    provides: Owner-conflict screen and logout confirmation flow
provides:
  - Green quality gate (lint, typecheck, unit, E2E, format) on the fully integrated phase result
  - Device-confirmed evidence that offline sessions and revoked-refresh-token sessions never lose unsynced surveys
  - Device-confirmed evidence for the logout-confirmation dialog, the other-account conflict screen, and absence of dev tools in a release build
  - Phase 01.2 validation sign-off (VALIDATION.md approved, with two items carried to Phase 7 / post-deploy)
affects: [phase-07-field-tests, phase-01.4, phase-01.5]

# Phase 01.2 Plan 09: Full quality gate and device verification Summary

**Full automated quality gate green on the integrated Phase 01.2 result, plus device-confirmed evidence (5 of 7 steps) that offline sessions, revoked-refresh-token sessions, logout, and the owner-conflict screen no longer lose field data — with the two remaining steps (nearby-parcels list, production rate limiting) carried over to Phase 7 and post-deploy checks.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 37 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T15:57:13Z (Task 1 commit cad5a11)
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23T16:34:41Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 1 (`03-VALIDATION.md`, across both task commits)

## Accomplishments

- Ran `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e && npm run format:check` plus the three phase-level grep checks on the fully integrated Phase 01.2 result — all green (Task 1, commit `cad5a11`).
- Developer ran the seven-step device verification protocol on a real phone against a local API and reported results verbatim; recorded per-step outcomes in the "Manual-Only Verifications" table of `03-VALIDATION.md` (Task 2).
- Confirmed on device: offline session keeps unsynced surveys and photos; a revoked refresh token ends the session without wiping the queue and syncs on re-login; logout with unsynced work shows the count and only purges on explicit confirmation; logging in as a different account shows the blocking "Relevés d'un autre compte" conflict screen with no sync; dev tools are absent from a release build.
- Recorded steps 6 (nearby-parcels list) and 7 (production rate limiting behind Caddy) as "not testable" pre-deploy/pre-field and carried them into `STATE.md` Pending Todos so they are not lost.
- Set `03-VALIDATION.md` frontmatter to `status: approved`, closed the `01.2-09-02` row, and recorded the phase Approval line.

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/03-stop-field-data-loss-and-account-exposure/03-VALIDATION.md` - Per-Task Verification Map fully green; Manual-Only Verifications table filled with per-step outcomes and an Outcome column; frontmatter `status: approved`; Approval line recorded
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Pending Todos records the two carried-over device checks (nearby-parcels field test, post-deploy rate-limit/TRUST_PROXY check); position/progress advanced; decision logged
- `.planning/phases/03-stop-field-data-loss-and-account-exposure/03-09-SUMMARY.md` - this file

## Decisions Made

- Device verification is treated as 5-of-7 confirmed with two explicit carry-overs rather than blocking the phase on conditions that cannot be satisfied pre-deploy (production rate limiting) or without field access to known parcels (step 6). Both carry-overs are tracked in `STATE.md` so they are not silently dropped.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. The developer's verbatim results ("confirmé" x5, "non testable" x2) mapped directly onto the plan's expected outcomes for steps 1-5 and the plan's own framing of steps 6-7 as dependent on a live deploy / field conditions.

## Issues Encountered

None. The `03-VALIDATION.md` Manual-Only Verifications table did not originally have a per-row Outcome column; one was added to make the device sign-off auditable per behavior rather than only via the single `01.2-09-02` map row.

Note: `grep -c "⬜ pending" .planning/phases/03-stop-field-data-loss-and-account-exposure/03-VALIDATION.md` returns `1` after this plan, not `0` — the remaining match is the legend line (`*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*`), not an open row. All actual rows in the Per-Task Verification Map are ✅.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 01.2 is fully validated: automated gate green, device behavior confirmed for the data-loss-critical paths (M-C1), and the corrective mobile release referenced in `STATE.md` blockers can proceed once the orchestrator's phase verification passes.
- Two carry-over checks remain open and are tracked in `STATE.md` Pending Todos: on-device nearby-parcels verification (targets Phase 7 field tests) and a post-deploy Caddy/rate-limit check (including whether `TRUST_PROXY=loopback,uniquelocal` is needed on the VPS).
- Phase 7 depends on 01.2, 01.4, and 01.5 per `STATE.md` Roadmap Evolution; 01.2 is now the first of those three to reach validation sign-off.
