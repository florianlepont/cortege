# Phase 1.2: Stop field data loss and account exposure - Research

**Researched:** 2026-09-23
**Domain:** Mobile session/error handling (react-native-auth0), NestJS rate limiting behind a reverse proxy, NestJS module conditional loading, Auth0 identity linking, SQLite local metadata
**Confidence:** HIGH (all claims below verified directly against the installed code and `node_modules`, not training-data recall)

## Summary

This phase closes five audit findings (M-C1, A-C1, A-H4, A-H1/A-M6, M-H3/M-H5) that either destroy
unsynced field data or expose accounts/endpoints. All five are narrow, well-isolated changes in
code already read and confirmed line-for-line during this research — there is no unknown technology
here, only careful classification of error types and a few call-site rewires.

The single most important fact, confirmed by reading `node_modules/react-native-auth0` source
directly: `CredentialsManagerError` (thrown by `credentialsManager.getCredentials()`) carries a
normalized, cross-platform `.type` string (`NO_NETWORK`, `RENEW_FAILED`, `NO_REFRESH_TOKEN`,
`NO_CREDENTIALS`, `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `UNKNOWN_ERROR`, etc. — full enum in
`CredentialsManagerErrorCodes`). Today's code (`useAuth0Session.ts:84-95`) throws this information
away with a bare `catch { return null }`, which is the entire root cause of M-C1. Fixing it is a
matter of classifying `.type` into two buckets (session-ending vs. retry-later), not inventing new
error-detection logic.

The second key fact: NestJS's global `ThrottlerGuard` (registered via `APP_GUARD`) runs **before**
any controller-scoped guard, including `AuthGuard`. This means `req.user` is **not** set when the
global throttler's `getTracker` executes — the remediation plan's phrase "per-user tracker when
authenticated" cannot literally read `request.user.id` at that point without reordering guards
(a larger, riskier change than this phase should make). The practical, verified-compatible fix is
to key the tracker on a hash of the raw `Authorization` bearer token when present (unique per
session, no JWT verification needed for bucketing purposes) and fall back to the trusted client IP
otherwise.

**Primary recommendation:** Implement the five fixes as five small, independently testable
changes exactly along the boundaries the audit already drew (L1-L4 in
`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md`), reusing the `local_meta` key-value table that already
exists in `mobile/src/storage/db.ts` for the "which account owns this local data" check, and reusing
`getMetaValue`/`setMetaValue` helpers already present in `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts`.

## User Constraints

No `CONTEXT.md` exists for this phase yet (this research was invoked before `/gsd:discuss-phase`).
There are no locked decisions or discretion notes to copy. The binding constraints below come from
`.planning/PROJECT.md` (Key Decisions, dated 2026-09-22/23) and `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (Phase 01.2
success criteria), both already authoritative:

- Email-based account linking is **kept**, not removed, but requires `email_verified === true`
  (PROJECT.md Key Decisions).
- Logout with unsynced work purges local data only after a confirmation that **counts** what will
  be lost; a session error **never** purges (PROJECT.md Key Decisions).
- Compatibility: installed apps must keep working — any API change must tolerate the mobile client's
  current behavior (e.g. it still sends `status: survey.status ?? "draft"` in upserts; that is a
  Phase 1.4 concern, not this phase's, but the same "never break installed clients" rule applies to
  every API surface this phase touches, e.g. `/v1/debug/*` returning 404 must not be a **breaking**
  contract change: current apps do not call it).
- REQ-QA-sql-injection and REQ-QA-indexes are explicitly **out of scope** for this phase (they are
  Phase 6).

## Phase Requirements

| ID | Description | Research Support |
|----|-------------|------------------|
| REQ-AUD-session-data-loss | Token-refresh failure (network/timeout/unknown) never deletes local data; only explicit refresh rejection ends session; queue survives re-login; logout confirms before purging; 401 retry forces refresh; pre-Auth0 stubs removed | `CredentialsManagerError.type` enum verified in `node_modules/react-native-auth0`; exact call chain verified in `useAuth0Session.ts`, `useSurveySync.ts`, `useSurveySyncNetwork.ts`; `forceRefresh` param verified on native bridge; `local_meta` table verified as the mechanism for "same account" check |
| REQ-AUD-rate-limit | Rate limiting keys on real client behind Caddy; per-user tracker when authenticated; production limit raised | `@nestjs/throttler@6.5.0` `getTracker`/`ThrottlerGuard` API verified in `node_modules`; guard execution order (global before controller) identified as the blocking architectural fact; `app.module.ts` current config (`limit: 10` prod) verified |
| REQ-AUD-debug-surface | DebugModule and HS256 test-token path not loaded in production; `/v1/debug/*` returns 404 | `debug.module.ts`, `debug.controller.ts`, `auth.guard.ts` read directly; E2E token-acquisition dependency on `/v1/debug/test-token` verified across 5 e2e-spec files; CI sets `NODE_ENV=test` (verified in `ci.yml`), no `DEBUG_DATA_RESET_ENABLED` var exists yet |
| REQ-AUD-identity | Email linking requires `email_verified===true`; race-free provisioning; report doesn't expose reporter | `auth.guard.ts:getOrProvisionUser` read directly (no `email_verified` check anywhere in the repo, confirmed by grep); `reports.service.ts` read directly (event payload includes `actor_id`+`reason`, exposed via `getEvents` to the survey owner); migrations 001/011 confirm `auth0_sub UNIQUE` and `email UNIQUE` already exist, enabling `ON CONFLICT` |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-quick-fixes | Dev tools absent from prod builds; bbox order fixed | `SettingsScreen.tsx` read directly (dev tools section always rendered, not gated by `__DEV__`); `useNearbyParcels.ts:73` and `map-viewport.ts:computeRegionBbox` read directly, confirming the exact reversed-order bug and the correct helper to reuse |

## Architectural Responsibility Map

| Capability | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Session error classification (network vs. auth-rejection) | Browser/Client (mobile hook) | — | `react-native-auth0`'s `CredentialsManagerError` is only available on-device; no server involvement |
| Local data retention on session error | Browser/Client (SQLite) | — | `local_surveys`/`sync_queue`/`local_attachments` are mobile-only tables; the API never sees this decision |
| Owner-account check after re-login | Browser/Client (local_meta) | API/Backend (auth `sub` in JWT) | The client must compare the JWT's `sub`/user id against a locally stored owner marker; the API only supplies the `sub`, it does not track "whose phone this is" |
| Rate-limit tracking | API/Backend (NestJS ThrottlerGuard) | CDN/Edge (Caddy `trust proxy`) | Caddy terminates TLS and proxies to loopback; Nest's throttler is the only component that can key per-client, but it depends on Caddy forwarding a trustworthy client identifier |
| Debug endpoint gating | API/Backend (module wiring + env) | — | Purely a NestJS module-registration and guard concern; no mobile or CDN involvement |
| Auth0 identity linking / provisioning | API/Backend (AuthGuard + UsersService) | — | Auth0 issues the JWT and `/userinfo`; the API owns the decision of whether to link accounts |
| Report reporter-identity redaction | API/Backend (SurveysService/ReportsService event payload) | — | The event payload is written and read entirely server-side; the mobile app only renders what the API returns |
| Dev-tools visibility | Browser/Client (build-time `__DEV__` / env flag) | — | Production/dev distinction is a mobile build-time concept; the API has no opinion |
| Nearby-parcels bbox format | Browser/Client (request construction) | API/Backend (already expects the correct order) | The API's contract (`minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat`) is already correct per `map-viewport.ts`; only the mobile caller is wrong |

## Standard Stack

### Core (already installed — no new runtime dependency required for the fixes themselves)

| Library | Version (verified) | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `react-native-auth0` | 5.4.1 [VERIFIED: node_modules] | Auth0 SDK, `credentialsManager.getCredentials()` | Already the project's Auth0 client (DEC-005); no alternative in scope |
| `@nestjs/throttler` | 6.5.0 [VERIFIED: node_modules] | Rate limiting / `ThrottlerGuard`, `@Throttle` decorator, custom `getTracker` | Already installed and wired in `app.module.ts`; this phase only reconfigures it |
| `jsonwebtoken` | ^9.0.3 [VERIFIED: api/package.json] | HS256 test-token signing, RS256 verification | Already used by `AuthGuard`; no change needed to the library itself |
| `jwks-rsa` | ^4.0.1 [VERIFIED: api/package.json] | JWKS fetch/caching for RS256 | Already used; unaffected by this phase |
| `expo-sqlite` | ~57.0.3 [VERIFIED: mobile/package.json] | `local_meta` key-value table already exists here | No new table engine needed |

### Supporting (test infrastructure only — needed to write the regression tests this phase requires)

| Library | Version (verified) | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `@testing-library/react-native` | 14.0.1 [VERIFIED: npm registry via `slopcheck`, not yet installed] | `renderHook` for testing `useAuth0Session`/`useSurveySync` behavior instead of spying on `React.useState` | Needed now to write the M-C1 regression tests the remediation plan calls for (L1 explicitly says "introduced here even though Phase 1.3/L7 generalises it") |
| `test-renderer` | 1.3.0 [VERIFIED: npm registry via `slopcheck`, not yet installed] | Peer dependency of `@testing-library/react-native@14.x` under React 19 (replaces the deprecated `react-test-renderer` for RNTL's internal use) | Installed alongside RNTL; keep the existing `react-test-renderer@19.2.3` root devDependency as-is (still used elsewhere), this is additive |

**Alternatives Considered**

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `@testing-library/react-native` + `renderHook` | Keep spying on `React.useState`/`useCallback`/`useEffect` (current pattern in `useSurveySync.test.ts`) | Current pattern is documented in the audit itself (T3) as fragile and non-behavioral; the remediation plan explicitly wants `renderHook` starting in this lot. Recommend introducing it now rather than deferring, since the M-C1 fix is exactly the kind of effect-ordering bug that `useState`-spying tests cannot catch. |
| Hashing the raw bearer token for the throttler tracker | Reordering guards so `AuthGuard` runs before the global `ThrottlerGuard` | Reordering is a much larger, riskier change (makes `AuthGuard` effectively global, requiring a `@Public()` escape hatch for `/v1/health` and public map endpoints that don't need auth) — out of proportion for this phase. The token-hash approach achieves "per-authenticated-session" bucketing with a one-line `getTracker` override. |
| `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub) DO UPDATE ... RETURNING` for provisioning | A `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` + advisory lock | `ON CONFLICT` is simpler, is what the remediation plan specifies, and `auth0_sub` already has a `UNIQUE` constraint (migration 011) — no schema change needed |

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install --workspace mobile @testing-library/react-native test-renderer
```
(Run from repo root; do not use `--save` flags that bypass the workspace target. Root `package.json`
must **not** gain these as root dependencies — they belong under `mobile/`.)

**Version verification:** `npm view @testing-library/react-native version` → `14.0.1`;
`npm view test-renderer version` → `1.3.0`. Both confirmed on 2026-09-23 against the live npm
registry via `slopcheck` (see Package Legitimacy Audit below). `@testing-library/react-native@14.0.1`
peer-depends on `react >=19.0.0` and `react-native >=0.78` (both satisfied: React 19.2.3, RN 0.86.3)
plus `test-renderer: ^1.0.0` as a peer — that peer must also be installed explicitly.

## Package Legitimacy Audit

Two new packages are proposed (test infrastructure only, mobile workspace). `slopcheck 0.6.1` was
installed and run directly against the npm registry.

| Package | Registry | Age | Downloads | Source Repo | slopcheck | Disposition |
|---------|----------|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `@testing-library/react-native` | npm | Long-established (React Native Testing Library, Callstack-maintained) | High (widely used in RN ecosystem) | `github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library` | [OK] | Approved |
| `test-renderer` | npm | Newer (React 19's replacement for deprecated `react-test-renderer`) | Lower but growing, is the officially-documented React-19-era replacement | `github.com/mdjastrzebski/test-renderer` | [OK] | Approved |

**Packages removed due to slopcheck [SLOP] verdict:** none.
**Packages flagged as suspicious [SUS]:** none.

Note on provenance: both package names were discovered via the official `@testing-library/react-native`
documentation's own peer-dependency declaration (read directly from the published package metadata,
`npm view @testing-library/react-native@latest peerDependencies`), which is an authoritative source,
not training-data recall. Combined with the `[OK]` slopcheck verdict and registry verification, these
qualify as `[VERIFIED: npm registry]`.

No new production/runtime packages are required for the API-side fixes (L2, L3) or the mobile
production-code fixes (L1, L4) — they use only libraries already declared in `package.json`.

**Caution — accidental install during research:** running `slopcheck install <pkg>` actually invokes
`npm install`. This research session ran it once, modifying the root `package.json`/`package-lock.json`;
those changes were reverted with `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json` before finishing.
The planner should instruct whoever runs `slopcheck` in a later phase to use a scratch directory or
expect it to mutate the lockfile, and to target the **mobile** workspace, not root, when actually
installing (`npm install --workspace mobile ...`).

                                                 ▼
                                          Local queue persists;
                                          re-login with SAME account
                                          (compare local_meta owner
                                          key to new JWT sub) →
                                          resume sync normally.
                                          Re-login with DIFFERENT
                                          account → explicit conflict
                                          state, do not silently merge.
```

Explicit logout is a **separate** path: `handleLogout()` must first check
`hasPendingSyncWork()` (already exists in `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts`) plus a count of
`local_attachments`, show a confirming `Alert` with the count, and only call
`clearLocalIbpData()` after the user confirms.

### Recommended file-level changes

```
mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts
  - getValidAccessToken(): classify CredentialsManagerError.type; throw distinguishable
    errors (e.g. new Error("AUTH_REQUIRED") vs new Error("AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE"))
  - withAuthRetry(): on 401, call getCredentials(undefined, undefined, undefined, true)
    (forceRefresh=true) instead of a second unconditional getValidAccessToken() call
  - restore-session effect (lines 139-194): apply the same classification; a network/
    temporary error during restore must NOT call clearSession()
  - remove: devVerificationToken, pendingEmailVerification, handleVerifyEmail,
    handleResendVerification, handleCancelEmailVerification, refreshToken: ""
    (all dead stubs, confirmed still present and returned from the hook)

mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts
  - clearSurveySessionState(): remove the `clearLocalIbpData()` call (line 54); keep only
    the React state resets (setSurveyDetails({}), setSurveyEvents({}), cooldown ref reset)
  - handleLogout: needs a NEW explicit confirm-then-purge path, separate from
    clearSession() used for session errors. This is new code, not present today —
    the hook currently has no logout-confirmation flow at all (handleLogout in
    useAuth0Session.ts just calls clearSession() unconditionally after Auth0 logout).

mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts / mobile/src/storage/sync.ts
  - Reuse existing setMetaValue/getMetaValue (sync.ts) to store/read an "owner" key in
    local_meta (e.g. key = 'session_owner_sub') set on successful login, compared on
    each subsequent login. A mismatch means "different account, same device" and must
    surface a decision point (this phase's success criterion 2: "local data is never
    attached to a different account after re-login" — exact UX to be decided in planning,
    but the mechanism — local_meta — is confirmed available with no schema change).

api/src/main.ts
  - Switch NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(AppModule) (import from
    "@nestjs/platform-express", already installed, version 11.1.21) so
    app.set("trust proxy", "loopback") is available. Confirmed: plain
    NestFactory.create(AppModule) returns an INestApplication without .set(); the
    Express-specific type is required for trust-proxy configuration.

api/src/app.module.ts
  - ThrottlerModule.forRoot([{ ttl, limit, getTracker }]) — raise default limit
    (currently 10/min in production, confirmed at app.module.ts:17) to the
    remediation-plan-recommended 100-300/min range; add named throttlers for
    /sync, uploads, /public/* via @Throttle() on individual controllers/routes.
  - Conditionally import DebugModule: only when
    process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" (matches the phase's literal wording:
    "not loaded in production"). The additional DEBUG_DATA_RESET_ENABLED flag from
    the remediation plan is optional polish; the phase's stated success criterion
    only requires "not loaded in production" — do not over-engineer beyond what's
    required unless the planner decides it adds safety margin.

api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts
  - Custom ThrottlerGuard subclass overriding getTracker(req): if req.headers
    .authorization exists, return a hash (e.g. sha256) of the bearer token;
    otherwise return req.ip. This works BEFORE AuthGuard runs (confirmed: global
    APP_GUARD executes before controller-scoped @UseGuards(AuthGuard)), so it
    cannot read req.user. Token-hash is the pragmatic substitute for "per-user."
  - HS256 branch (verifyTestToken, gated on process.env.NODE_ENV === "test",
    lines 42-46 and 57-70): extract into a dedicated guard used only by a test
    module, OR keep it but ensure it is unreachable in production by the same
    NODE_ENV !== "test" default already in place — confirmed this already only
    activates when NODE_ENV is exactly "test", so the real risk is DebugModule's
    /debug/test-token endpoint being reachable (mitigated by the DebugModule
    conditional import above) plus its own internal
    `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "test") throw new ForbiddenException()` guard
    (confirmed present at debug.controller.ts:17) — belt-and-suspenders, both
    already partially in place, this phase must not accidentally remove the
    inner check while doing the module-level gating.
  - getOrProvisionUser(): add `userInfo.email_verified === true` check before the
    `byEmail` UPDATE branch; if false, fall through to the INSERT path (creates a
    new user instead of linking). Replace the two-step
    SELECT-then-INSERT (race condition, confirmed present, no locking) with
    `INSERT INTO users (...) VALUES (...) ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub) DO UPDATE SET
    auth0_sub = EXCLUDED.auth0_sub RETURNING ...` — auth0_sub already has a
    UNIQUE constraint (migration 011), so ON CONFLICT works with no schema change.

api/src/reports/reports.service.ts
  - createReport(): stop writing `actor_id` and `reason` into the survey_events
    payload (confirmed at reports.service.ts:56-60, the `reported` event insert).
    Store report metadata only in the `reports` table (already has reporter_user_id,
    reason columns) which is not exposed via GET /surveys/:id/events (that endpoint
    only reads survey_events, confirmed at surveys.service.ts:768-780). A new
    migration should scrub `reason`/`actor_id` out of existing `reported`-type
    survey_events rows (UPDATE ... SET payload = '{}'::jsonb WHERE event_type =
    'reported').
  - Optional (present in audit but not in this phase's stated success criteria):
    @MaxLength on reason, dedup constraint on (reporter_id, survey_id). Flag as
    discretionary — not required by ROADMAP.md's phase 1.2 success criteria list,
    but cheap to include if the planner wants to fully close A-M6/A-H1 in one pass.

mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx
  - Wrap the "Outils développeur" AppCollapsibleSection in `if (__DEV__) { ... }`
    (confirmed section is unconditional today, lines ~219-238 as audited, verified
    directly: no __DEV__ guard exists anywhere in this file). Note: `__DEV__` is
    already used elsewhere in the codebase (auth0-config.ts, AuthGateScreen.tsx) —
    this is an established pattern, not a new one.

mobile/src/hooks/useNearbyParcels.ts
  - Line 73: change bbox construction from
    `${lng - RADIUS_DEG},${lng + RADIUS_DEG},${lat - RADIUS_DEG},${lat + RADIUS_DEG}`
    to reuse `computeRegionBbox` from `mobile/src/app/map-viewport.ts` (already
    produces the correct `minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat` order) rather than
    hand-rolling a second, incompatible bbox string builder.
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Swallowing all errors into `null`/`catch {}`:** this is the literal cause of M-C1
  (`getValidAccessToken` in `useAuth0Session.ts:84-95`). Every future auth-adjacent
  `try/catch` in this codebase should classify the error, never discard its type.
- **Guessing at Auth0 error semantics instead of reading `CredentialsManagerError.type`:**
  the SDK already normalizes platform differences (iOS/Android/web); do not re-derive
  "is this a network error" from string-matching `error.message`.
- **Assuming `req.user` is populated in a global `APP_GUARD`:** confirmed false in this
  codebase; any rate-limiting or logging logic that wants "the authenticated user" in a
  global guard must either decode the JWT itself (without verification, for non-security
  purposes only) or move to a controller/method-scoped guard that runs after `AuthGuard`.

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Classifying Auth0 credential errors | Custom regex/message matching on error text | `error.type` from `CredentialsManagerError` (react-native-auth0 5.4.1) | Already normalized across iOS/Android/web by the SDK; confirmed via `node_modules/react-native-auth0/lib/typescript/src/core/models/CredentialsManagerError.d.ts` |
| Forcing a fresh token after 401 | Re-calling `getCredentials()` with no arguments (current behavior — reuses cache) | `getCredentials(scope, minTtl, parameters, forceRefresh=true)` — 4th positional arg, confirmed supported on native bridge | The current retry calls `getValidAccessToken()` again, which does NOT force a refresh; this is a real (if lower-severity) bug independently confirmed in `useAuth0Session.ts:108` |
| Per-client rate-limit keys behind a reverse proxy | Manually parsing `X-Forwarded-For` | Express's built-in `trust proxy` setting via `NestExpressApplication` | Express handles the XFF chain correctly once `trust proxy` is configured; hand-parsing is a known spoofing vector if done wrong |
| Race-free "first login creates the user" | SELECT-then-INSERT with app-level locking | `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub) DO UPDATE ... RETURNING` | Postgres already guarantees atomicity here; `auth0_sub` is already `UNIQUE` (migration 011), so no schema change is needed to use it |

**Key insight:** every fix in this phase replaces a hand-rolled, incomplete mechanism with a
capability the already-installed library or already-existing database constraint provides. No new
abstraction needs to be invented.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Fixing M-C1 by only changing `getValidAccessToken`, missing the restore-session path
**What goes wrong:** The audit's own trace shows TWO independent call chains end in
`clearLocalIbpData()`: the `useSurveySyncNetwork` AUTH_REQUIRED path, AND the session-restore
`catch` block in `useAuth0Session.ts:182-186` on app launch. A fix that only reclassifies errors in
`getValidAccessToken` but leaves the restore-effect's blanket `catch { clearSession() }` untouched
will still wipe data if the app is force-quit and relaunched with no network.
**Why it happens:** the two paths look similar but are in different effects/functions.
**How to avoid:** apply the same classification logic to both call sites; write a regression test
for both (app restore offline + mid-session network blip during sync).
**Warning signs:** a test that only mocks `useSurveySyncNetwork`'s error handling will pass while
the restore-effect bug remains.

### Pitfall 2: Believing `req.user` is available to a global `ThrottlerGuard`
**What goes wrong:** A naive `getTracker: (req) => req.user?.id ?? req.ip` will always fall through
to `req.ip`, because `AuthGuard` (controller-scoped) has not run yet when the global `ThrottlerGuard`
(APP_GUARD) executes. Silently degrades to "IP-only" tracking with no error — easy to miss.
**Why it happens:** guard execution order in NestJS is global → controller → method, not the reverse.
**How to avoid:** verified fact, documented above; use a bearer-token hash instead of `req.user`, or
add an explicit E2E test asserting two different users behind the SAME IP get independent buckets.
**Warning signs:** load-testing shows two authenticated users sharing a rate-limit bucket despite
different accounts.

### Pitfall 3: Breaking the E2E suite by making `DebugModule`'s conditional import too strict
**What goes wrong:** All of `auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts`, `epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts`,
`surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts`, and `validation-reports.e2e-spec.ts` (confirmed: 4 files, ~30+
call sites) call `POST /v1/debug/test-token` to obtain a bearer token. If `DebugModule` is gated
on anything CI does not already set (`NODE_ENV=test`, confirmed in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`),
the entire E2E suite breaks.
**Why it happens:** the natural fix ("only load DebugModule outside production") is correct, but a
planner might over-tighten it (e.g. gate on a new env var CI doesn't set).
**How to avoid:** gate strictly on `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` (CI already sets
`NODE_ENV: test`, confirmed at `ci.yml:86`); do not introduce a new required env var unless it is
also added to `ci.yml`'s `env:` block in the same change.
**Warning signs:** `npm run test:e2e` starts failing with 404s from `/v1/debug/test-token`.

### Pitfall 4: Assuming `moduleNameMapper` duplication in `jest.unit.config.js` needs fixing in this phase
**What goes wrong:** the second `moduleNameMapper` block (confirmed present, silently overriding the
first, which only had `@expo/vector-icons`) is a known bug (T4), but it is explicitly scoped to
Phase 1.3 (REQ-AUD-test-infra, lot L7), not this phase. Spending time consolidating it here is scope
creep. `testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts']` (missing `.tsx`) has the same status.
**Why it happens:** it's adjacent code, touched while adding `renderHook`-based tests for M-C1.
**How to avoid:** only touch what L1 (this phase's mobile lot) needs — adding `.test.ts` files using
`renderHook` is fine (they still match `testMatch`); do not "fix" the duplicated `moduleNameMapper` or
extend `testMatch` to `.tsx` as a drive-by change; that belongs to Phase 1.3.

### Pitfall 5: Conflating `email_verified` linking with removing linking entirely
**What goes wrong:** `docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md` §5 raises an open decision ("delete
linking entirely if all accounts already have `auth0_sub`, recommended if verified by a SQL query in
production"). PROJECT.md's Key Decisions table has already settled this for the milestone: "Email-
based account linking is **kept** but requires `email_verified === true`." A planner reading only the
audit might re-litigate this; PROJECT.md is authoritative and should not be re-opened without a new
user decision.
**How to avoid:** implement the `email_verified` gate; do not remove the linking code path.

## Code Examples

### Classifying CredentialsManagerError (M-C1 core fix)
```typescript
// Source: node_modules/react-native-auth0/lib/typescript/src/core/models/CredentialsManagerError.d.ts
// (types verified directly from the installed 5.4.1 package)
import { CredentialsManagerError, CredentialsManagerErrorCodes } from "react-native-auth0"

const SESSION_ENDING_CODES = new Set<string>([
  CredentialsManagerErrorCodes.NO_CREDENTIALS,
  CredentialsManagerErrorCodes.NO_REFRESH_TOKEN,
  CredentialsManagerErrorCodes.INVALID_CREDENTIALS,
  CredentialsManagerErrorCodes.RENEW_FAILED, // covers invalid_grant / Auth0 401-403 on refresh
])

function classifyCredentialsError(error: unknown): "AUTH_REQUIRED" | "AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE" {
  if (error instanceof CredentialsManagerError && SESSION_ENDING_CODES.has(error.type)) {
    return "AUTH_REQUIRED"
  }
  // NO_NETWORK, API_ERROR, UNKNOWN_ERROR, CRYPTO_EXCEPTION, timeouts, or any
  // non-CredentialsManagerError (e.g. a thrown plain Error from a flaky bridge call)
  // all mean "try again later", never "wipe local data".
  return "AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE"
}
```
Note: `RENEW_FAILED` is the SDK's cross-platform normalization of Auth0's `invalid_grant` /
401/403-on-refresh outcomes (confirmed via the SDK's own JSDoc: "Failed to refresh credentials using
refresh token"). It does not distinguish "revoked because you logged out elsewhere" from a hard
network failure during the refresh call itself at the SDK level — if finer-grained distinction is
needed, the planner should note this as a residual LOW-confidence area (see Open Questions).

### Forcing a token refresh on 401
```typescript
// Source: node_modules/react-native-auth0/lib/typescript/src/core/interfaces/ICredentialsManager.ts
// getCredentials(scope?, minTtl?, parameters?, forceRefresh?)
const refreshed = await getAuth0().credentialsManager.getCredentials(
  undefined,
  undefined,
  undefined,
  true, // forceRefresh — confirmed supported by NativeCredentialsManager, passed straight to native bridge
)
```

### Custom ThrottlerGuard tracker (per-session, IP fallback)
```typescript
// Source: @nestjs/throttler 6.5.0, node_modules/@nestjs/throttler/dist/throttler.guard.d.ts
// (protected getTracker(req): Promise<string> — override point confirmed in the installed package)
import { createHash } from "crypto"
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common"
import { ThrottlerGuard } from "@nestjs/throttler"

@Injectable()
export class ClientAwareThrottlerGuard extends ThrottlerGuard {
  protected async getTracker(req: Record<string, any>): Promise<string> {
    const authHeader = req.headers?.authorization
    if (typeof authHeader === "string" && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
      // req.user is NOT set here (global guard runs before controller-scoped AuthGuard) —
      // hash the token itself instead of trying to read req.user.
      return `token:${createHash("sha256").update(authHeader).digest("hex")}`
    }
    return `ip:${req.ip}`
  }
}
```

### Enabling `trust proxy` (requires the Express-typed app)
```typescript
// Source: @nestjs/platform-express 11.1.21 (installed), confirmed NestExpressApplication
// exposes .set() via express under the hood.
import { NestExpressApplication } from "@nestjs/platform-express"

const app = await NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(AppModule)
app.set("trust proxy", "loopback") // Caddy is the only proxy, confirmed in infra/vps setup
```

### Race-free provisioning with existing UNIQUE constraint
```sql
-- auth0_sub UNIQUE already exists: api/migrations/011_auth0_migration.sql:7
INSERT INTO users (id, auth0_sub, email, display_name, first_name, last_name, role)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), $1, $2, $3, '', '', 'contributor')
ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub) DO UPDATE SET auth0_sub = EXCLUDED.auth0_sub
RETURNING id, auth0_sub, email, role, first_name, last_name, display_name, profile_picture_url;
```

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| `react-test-renderer` for RN hook/component tests under React 19 | `test-renderer` (new package) + `@testing-library/react-native@14.x` | React 19 deprecated the legacy test renderer; RNTL 14 was released to depend on the new `test-renderer` package instead | If this phase adds `renderHook`-based tests, it must pull in `test-renderer` alongside RNTL 14, not rely solely on the already-present `react-test-renderer@19.2.3` |
| Spying on `React.useState`/`useCallback` to test hooks (current `useSurveySync.test.ts` pattern) | `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-native` | Recommended by the audit (T3) and explicitly called for starting in lot L1 | Tests actually exercise effect ordering and re-render behavior, which is exactly what M-C1's bug class needs to be caught by a regression test |

**Deprecated/outdated:**
- `react-test-renderer` is not deprecated for existing use (it still works), but is not the renderer
  `@testing-library/react-native@14.x` uses internally under React 19 — both packages can coexist.

## Assumptions Log

| # | Claim | Section | Risk if Wrong |
|---|-------|---------|---------------|
| A1 | `RENEW_FAILED` is the correct/sufficient proxy for "Auth0 explicitly rejected the refresh token (invalid_grant, 401/403)" and does not also fire on some transient server-side 5xx during refresh | Code Examples, Pitfall notes | If `RENEW_FAILED` can also occur on a flaky-but-recoverable server error, classifying it as `AUTH_REQUIRED` could still wipe local data on a bad network day. The SDK's own docs only say "Failed to refresh credentials using refresh token" without enumerating HTTP-status-to-code mapping; this was NOT independently verified against a live Auth0 tenant in this research session (no network access to Auth0 in this sandbox). Recommend the planner add a regression test that simulates a `RENEW_FAILED` from a *timeout* specifically, and verify manually against a real Auth0 tenant during implementation whether `RENEW_FAILED` needs to be split further. |
| A2 | A hashed-bearer-token tracker key is an acceptable interpretation of "per-user tracker when authenticated" for REQ-AUD-rate-limit, given that `req.user` is unavailable at global-guard time | Standard Stack / Alternatives, Code Examples | If the planner or a reviewer insists on literal per-`user.id` tracking, a larger guard-reordering change (making AuthGuard global with a `@Public()` escape hatch) would be needed instead — a bigger, riskier change than this research recommends. This is a design decision for discuss-phase/planning, not something this research can unilaterally resolve. |
| A3 | Gating `DebugModule` import strictly on `NODE_ENV !== "production"` satisfies "not loaded in production" without needing a new `DEBUG_DATA_RESET_ENABLED` env var (which the remediation plan suggests but which does not exist in the codebase or CI today) | Common Pitfalls (Pitfall 3), Architecture Patterns | If ops wants a belt-and-suspenders double flag (recommended by the audit's remediation plan, not by the phase's literal success criteria), the planner should add `DEBUG_DATA_RESET_ENABLED` to `ci.yml`'s env block in the same change, or skip it — this is a discretionary scope call, not a blocking unknown |

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

1. **Does Auth0's refresh-token rejection always surface as `CredentialsManagerError.type === "RENEW_FAILED"` on both iOS and Android, or can it also surface as `NO_REFRESH_TOKEN` in some flows (e.g. refresh token rotation with a revoked token)?**
   - What we know: the SDK enum documents both codes with distinct meanings ("Refresh token is not available" vs. "Failed to refresh credentials using refresh token"); `NO_REFRESH_TOKEN` doc explicitly says "ensure offline_access scope was requested," suggesting it is more about missing scope than revocation.
   - What's unclear: whether a genuinely revoked/rotated-out refresh token (the exact M-C1 "invalid_grant" scenario) always lands on `RENEW_FAILED` specifically, verified only against SDK doc comments, not a live device test.
   - **RESOLVED** by CONTEXT D-01 and D-01a: `NO_REFRESH_TOKEN` ends the session; `RENEW_FAILED` ends it only when online; `NO_CREDENTIALS` only at restore. Live-tenant check in plan 01.2-09.
   - Recommendation (original): treat both `RENEW_FAILED` and `NO_REFRESH_TOKEN` as session-ending (`AUTH_REQUIRED`) — both indicate "we cannot get a valid token from stored credentials," which is the correct behavior regardless of the exact sub-cause. Do NOT treat `NO_CREDENTIALS` (simply never logged in) differently from these for this hook's purposes, since all three converge on "user must log in again."

2. **What exact UX should "local data attached to a different account after re-login" trigger — silent account-swap prevention, a blocking dialog, or a merge prompt?**
   - What we know: `local_meta` is available to store an owner marker; success criterion 2 only requires that this attachment "is never" allowed, not what UX replaces it.
   - What's unclear: whether the correct behavior is "refuse to sync until the user explicitly discards or exports the old account's local data" vs. "auto-clear only after the SAME confirm-and-count flow used for logout."
   - **RESOLVED** by CONTEXT D-04: sync stays suspended and the user chooses between logging back in with the owning account or deleting after confirmation — no merge (plans 01.2-07 and 01.2-08).
   - Recommendation (original): reuse the logout confirmation flow (count + confirm) for this case too — when a login succeeds and `local_meta.session_owner_sub` exists and differs from the new JWT's `sub`, show the same "N surveys / M photos will be lost" confirmation before either purging or blocking. This keeps one UX pattern instead of two. Flag for `/gsd:discuss-phase` to confirm before planning task-level details.

## Validation Architecture

### Test Framework

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework (mobile) | Jest 29.7 + ts-jest, `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` |
| Framework (api) | Jest 29 + ts-jest, `api/jest.unit.config.js` (unit) / `api/jest.config.js` (E2E) |
| Config file | `mobile/jest.unit.config.js`, `api/jest.unit.config.js`, `api/jest.config.js` |
| Quick run command | `npm run test:unit` (root — runs both api and mobile unit suites) |
| Full suite command | `npm run test` (root — unit + E2E; E2E requires PostgreSQL via `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d`) |

### Phase Requirements → Test Map

| Req ID | Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists? |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| REQ-AUD-session-data-loss | Network error during token refresh does not call `clearLocalIbpData()` | unit (renderHook) | `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- useAuth0Session` | ❌ Wave 0 (new file, e.g. `useAuth0Session.test.ts` rewritten with `renderHook`) |
| REQ-AUD-session-data-loss | `RENEW_FAILED`/invalid_grant ends session but preserves `sync_queue`/`local_attachments` | unit (renderHook) | `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- useSurveySync` | ⚠️ Partial — `useSurveySync.test.ts` exists but uses the spy pattern; needs `renderHook` rewrite or an additive test file |
| REQ-AUD-session-data-loss | Logout with pending work shows a count and purges only after confirm | unit (renderHook) | new test file | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-session-data-loss | 401 on an API call forces `getCredentials(..., true)` | unit | extend `useAuth0Session.test.ts` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-rate-limit | Two clients behind the same proxy IP but different bearer tokens get independent throttle buckets | E2E | `npm --workspace api run test:e2e -- rate-limit` (new spec) | ❌ Wave 0 (new `rate-limit.e2e-spec.ts`) |
| REQ-AUD-debug-surface | `/v1/debug/*` returns 404 when `NODE_ENV=production` | unit or E2E with env override | new test, e.g. `debug-module-gating.spec.ts` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-identity | Unverified email does not link; verified email does | unit | extend `api/test/auth.guard.spec.ts` | ⚠️ File exists (`auth.guard.spec.ts`) but does not currently cover email-linking branches (confirmed via grep — no `email_verified` references anywhere in the test suite) |
| REQ-AUD-identity | Concurrent first-login requests produce exactly one user row | E2E | extend `api/test/auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts` | ⚠️ File exists, scenario not covered today |
| REQ-AUD-identity | Survey owner cannot see reporter identity via `GET /surveys/:id/events` | E2E | extend `api/test/epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` or `validation-reports.e2e-spec.ts` | ⚠️ Files exist, scenario not covered today (confirmed no assertion on event payload redaction) |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-quick-fixes | Dev tools section absent when `__DEV__` is false | unit | new test for `SettingsScreen.tsx` | ❌ Wave 0 — no existing test file for `SettingsScreen.tsx` at all (0% coverage per audit, confirmed: `mobile/jest.unit.config.js`'s `testMatch` wouldn't even catch a `.test.tsx` file for this screen without also being renamed `.test.ts`, or the Phase 1.3 `testMatch` fix landing first — **this phase should write the new test as `.test.ts` testing a small extracted helper/hook rather than the `.tsx` screen component**, to avoid depending on the Phase 1.3 `testMatch` fix) |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-quick-fixes | `useNearbyParcels` sends bbox in `minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat` order | unit | `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- useNearbyParcels` | ❌ Wave 0 (no existing test file for this hook) |

### Sampling Rate
- **Per task commit:** `npm run test:unit` (fast, no DB dependency for most of this phase's tests; the rate-limit and identity/report tests need `npm run test:e2e`)
- **Per wave merge:** `npm run test` (unit + E2E; requires `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d` for PostgreSQL)
- **Phase gate:** Full suite green before `/gsd:verify-work`, plus a manual smoke check against a real Auth0 tenant for the `RENEW_FAILED` classification (Open Question 1) since it cannot be fully verified by mocked unit tests alone.

### Wave 0 Gaps
- [ ] `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.test.ts` — rewrite using `renderHook`, covers session-error classification and forceRefresh
- [ ] `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts` — extend or add `renderHook`-based coverage for the logout-confirmation flow and `clearSurveySessionState` no longer purging
- [ ] `mobile/src/hooks/useNearbyParcels.test.ts` — new, covers bbox order
- [ ] `mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen` dev-tools visibility — needs either a small extracted testable helper (e.g. `shouldShowDevTools()`) or acceptance that this specific check is manual/deferred until Phase 1.3's `testMatch` fix lands
- [ ] `api/test/rate-limit.e2e-spec.ts` — new
- [ ] `api/test/auth.guard.spec.ts` — extend for `email_verified` gating
- [ ] `api/test/auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts` — extend for concurrent-provisioning race test
- [ ] `api/test/epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` or `validation-reports.e2e-spec.ts` — extend for reporter-identity redaction
- [ ] Framework install: `npm install --workspace mobile @testing-library/react-native test-renderer` — required before any `renderHook` test can be written

## Security Domain

### Applicable ASVS Categories

| ASVS Category | Applies | Standard Control |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| V2 Authentication | yes | Auth0 RS256 JWT via JWKS (existing, DEC-005); this phase adds `email_verified` gating on account linking |
| V3 Session Management | yes | `react-native-auth0` `credentialsManager` (Keychain/EncryptedSharedPreferences-backed, existing); this phase fixes session-error handling, does not change storage |
| V4 Access Control | yes | `AdminGuard` (existing, unaffected); `AuthGuard`'s HS256 test-path scoping is tightened by module gating |
| V5 Input Validation | no new surface in this phase | `ValidationPipe` already global (existing); this phase does not add new DTOs (that is Phase 1.4, REQ-AUD-sync-validation) |
| V6 Cryptography | no new surface | No new crypto primitives; the throttler tracker uses Node's built-in `crypto.createHash("sha256")` for a non-security-critical bucketing key (not a secret, not compared in constant time — appropriate for this use, not a security boundary) |

### Known Threat Patterns for this stack

| Pattern | STRIDE | Standard Mitigation |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Account takeover via unverified email linking (A-H1) | Spoofing | Require `userInfo.email_verified === true` before linking an unknown Auth0 `sub` to an existing user row by email |
| Denial of service via single-counter rate limiting (A-C1) | Denial of Service | `trust proxy` + per-client tracking so one client's burst cannot exhaust the global bucket |
| Information disclosure via event payload (A-M6) | Information Disclosure | Remove `actor_id`/`reason` from the `reported` survey_events payload; keep that data only in the access-controlled `reports` table |
| Debug/test-auth surface reachable in production (A-H4) | Elevation of Privilege | Conditionally load `DebugModule` outside production; keep the existing `NODE_ENV === "test"` inner guards as defense-in-depth |
| Race condition on first-login user creation (A-H1) | Tampering (duplicate/inconsistent state) | `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)` — atomic at the database level |

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH — every library/version confirmed directly against `node_modules` or the npm registry, not recalled from training data
- Architecture: HIGH — every file, line reference, and call chain confirmed by reading the actual source in this session
- Pitfalls: HIGH — each pitfall traces to a specific, re-verified line of code or a verified library behavior (guard ordering, `testMatch` pattern, CI env)
- Security domain: HIGH for the five in-scope findings; MEDIUM for the residual `RENEW_FAILED` edge case (Assumption A1)

**Research date:** 2026-09-23
**Valid until:** 2026-10-07 (30 days is too long given `react-native-auth0` and `@nestjs/throttler` are both actively maintained packages; re-verify versions if planning is delayed more than 2 weeks)
