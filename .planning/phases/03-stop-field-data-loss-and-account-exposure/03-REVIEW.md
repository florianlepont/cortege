# Phase 01.2: Code Review Report

**Reviewed:** 2026-09-23
**Depth:** standard
**Files Reviewed:** 56
**Status:** issues_found

## Narrative Findings (AI reviewer)

## Summary

I reviewed the production code for credential-error classification, the no-purge session end, owner-gated sync with confirmed logout purge, the client-aware throttler with trust proxy, DebugModule gating, email_verified linking with ON CONFLICT provisioning, report-event redaction with migration 013, dev-tools gating and bbox order. I read the tests only to check coverage of the paths below.

Several parts are correct and safe for installed clients:
- Credential classification follows D-01/D-01a, and react-native-auth0 5.4.1 does wrap native errors in `CredentialsManagerError`.
- The bbox now matches the server's `parseBbox` order.
- Migration 013 is idempotent and matches the JSONB column type. Mobile already types `actor_id` as optional/nullable.
- Throttler 6.5.0 honours a per-throttler `getTracker`, so the "ip" ceiling really is keyed on IP.

The main defect is the D-04 guarantee "nothing is ever sent under the wrong account". `syncAllowed` is not tied to the account whose ownership was checked, so a switch from account A to account B can briefly run sync with B's token against A's local queue. Two other paths skip the gate entirely. On the API, the new unverified-email refusal breaks D-09's race-free provisioning for new email/password sign-ups. Verified linking can also silently move an already-linked account to a new Auth0 identity. The default `TRUST_PROXY=loopback` very likely leaves every production request keyed on the Docker gateway IP.

## Critical Issues

### CR-01: `syncAllowed` stays "ok" for the previous account when the session owner changes from A to B, so a sync runs with B's token against A's unsynced data

**File:** `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts:113-126`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.ts:102-126,287-292`, `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts:302-319,365-367`
**Issue:** `syncAllowed` is `status === "ok"`, and `status` does not record which `sub` it was computed for. `sessionOwner` can change from A to B without passing through `null`:
1. Restore offline. Restore sets `accessToken` and `sessionOwner = A`, the owner check resolves to `"ok"`, but `currentUser` stays `null`.
2. The AuthGate overlay therefore shows, since `isAuthenticated = Boolean(currentUser)`.
3. `handleLogin`, `handleRegister` or `handleForgotPassword` now calls `setAccessToken(B)` and `setSessionOwner(B)` in one batched render.

In that commit, `useLocalDataOwner`'s effect calls `recheck()`. Its `setStatus("checking")` is only a queued update. The network effect `[accessToken, syncAllowed, maybeAutoSync]` then runs with the closure from the same render, where `syncAllowed === true` and `accessToken` is B's. `maybeAutoSync("auth-ready")` then:
- awaits `hasPendingSyncWork()`;
- calls `runSync("auto")`, which also has `syncAllowed === true` captured;
- calls `withAuthRetry`, which reads B's credentials from the credentials manager;
- sends A's pending queue under B with `syncPending`, and pulls B's server surveys into A's local database.

The `"conflict"` status arrives only after the SQLite reads finish, which is too late. The network-listener effect has the same stale closure and re-fires `"startup"`, because `maybeAutoSync` changes identity with `accessToken`. The pending work that gets sent is A's queue items that were eligible but not yet drained, for example after server or network errors. This is exactly the data D-04 must protect.
**Fix:** Tie the permission to the checked `sub`, and re-check at execution time rather than trusting a closure:
```ts
// useLocalDataOwner.ts
const [okForSub, setOkForSub] = useState<string | null>(null)
// in every branch that sets "ok":   setOkForSub(currentOwner.sub)
// in the effect / idle / checking:  setOkForSub(null)
const syncAllowed = status === "ok" && okForSub !== null && okForSub === sessionOwner?.sub

// expose a ref-based guard for async callers
const isSyncAllowedNow = useCallback(async () => {
  const owner = sessionOwnerRef.current
  if (!owner) return false
  const stored = await getLocalDataOwner()
  return stored?.sub === owner.sub
}, [])
```
Also call `isSyncAllowedNow()` inside `runSync` and `maybeAutoSync`, right before `syncPending` or `pullRemoteChanges`. As a further safeguard, have `withAuthRetry` compare the `sub` of the token it fetched with the stored owner. Add a `renderHook` test that rerenders with `sessionOwner` going directly from A to B while the status is `"ok"`, and asserts that `syncPending` is never called.

## Warnings

### WR-01: Visibility toggle and attachment deletion drain the whole sync queue without the owner gate

**File:** `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts:221,385`, called through `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts:1106`
**Issue:** `handleToggleVisibility` calls `updateSurveyVisibility`, which calls `syncPending(apiUrl, accessToken)` internally. `handleDeleteAttachment` calls `syncPending` directly. Both drain the entire `sync_queue`, including any other account's operations, and neither checks `syncAllowed`. The network hook's comment says owner suspension covers "every automatic and manual sync/pull path", but that is only true while the conflict overlay happens to cover the UI. During `"checking"`, `"error"` or `"idle"` with a token present, these two paths send the queue anyway, contradicting the default-deny claim in `useLocalDataOwner.ts:17`.
**Fix:** Pass `syncAllowed` (or `isSyncAllowedNow` from CR-01) into `useSurveySyncSurveyOperations`. When it is false, queue the change locally and skip `syncPending`. For visibility, pass an empty token so `updateSurveyVisibility` takes its "queued locally" branch.

### WR-02: A concurrent first login with an unverified email gets a 401, so D-09 provisioning is not race-free

**File:** `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts:150-159`
**Issue:** In the unverified branch, `SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE email = $1` runs before the `INSERT … ON CONFLICT`. If two first-login requests for the same `sub` arrive together, request 1 inserts the row. Request 2 has already passed the `auth0_sub` lookup, now finds its own freshly created row by email, and throws "Refusing to link…", which becomes a 401. The 23505 re-select never runs because the throw happens before the insert.

The mobile client does send concurrent requests on first login. `handleLogin` sets `accessToken`, the owner check adopts, and `maybeAutoSync("auth-ready")` pulls `/sync/changes` while `getMyProfile` is still waiting on `/userinfo`. When the loser is `getMyProfile` in `handleLogin`, which does not retry, a brand-new email/password user sees "API token rejected" on sign-up. The same happens to users with no email claim, because they get the synthetic email and `email_verified` is undefined.
**Fix:** Exclude the caller's own row, or insert first and classify the conflict:
```ts
const byEmail = await this.db.query<{ auth0_sub: string | null }>(
  `SELECT auth0_sub FROM users WHERE email = $1`, [email])
if (byEmail.rows.length > 0 && byEmail.rows[0].auth0_sub !== auth0Sub) {
  throw new ForbiddenException("email_already_linked")
}
```
In the 23505 handler, re-select by `auth0_sub` before deciding it is a refusal.

### WR-03: Verified-email linking overwrites an `auth0_sub` that is already set, so the account moves between identities

**File:** `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts:142-146`
**Issue:** `UPDATE users SET auth0_sub = $1 WHERE email = $2` has no `AND auth0_sub IS NULL`. Take a user whose account is already linked to `auth0|abc`. When they sign in once with Google (a different `sub`, verified email), the row is re-pointed to `google-oauth2|…`. The original identity no longer matches in the first `SELECT`:
- If its `/userinfo` reports `email_verified: false`, which is common for database connections, it now gets a 401 on every request. The user is locked out of their own account.
- If it reports `true`, the two identities keep taking the row back from each other on every first-request cycle.

D-08 intends to link pre-Auth0 or unlinked accounts, not to reassign linked ones.
**Fix:** `UPDATE users SET auth0_sub = $1 WHERE email = $2 AND auth0_sub IS NULL RETURNING …`. If a verified email matches a row already linked to another `sub`, either refuse with an explicit 403 or record a secondary identity. Do not silently reassign.

### WR-04: Refusing provisioning returns 401, so the client force-refreshes tokens on every request and shows a misleading message

**File:** `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts:157,51-54`; `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts:246-251,373-377`
**Issue:** The account-takeover refusal is a policy decision, not an invalid token. Every error in `canActivate` becomes `UnauthorizedException`. On mobile, each 401 triggers `getCredentials(…, forceRefresh=true)`, and the 30 s heartbeat repeats this. The result is a refresh-token rotation every 30 s for a user who can never succeed. `handleLogin` also shows "API token rejected", which suggests a configuration fault rather than "this email already belongs to an account".
**Fix:** Throw `ForbiddenException` with a stable code (for example `email_already_linked`) from the refusal path, and let it pass through the `catch` in `canActivate`, for example by rethrowing `HttpException`. On mobile, map 403 with that code to a clear French message, and do not force a refresh.

### WR-05: With the default `TRUST_PROXY=loopback`, production most likely keys every request on the Docker bridge gateway

**File:** `api/src/app.setup.ts:15`, `infra/docker-compose.vps.yml:61-62`, `infra/vps/env.example:57`
**Issue:** The API publishes on `127.0.0.1:3000`, and Caddy on the host connects to that loopback address. With Docker's default `userland-proxy`, loopback-published ports are relayed by `docker-proxy`, so the container sees the bridge gateway (`172.x.0.1`) as the peer rather than `127.0.0.1`. That address is not trusted under `"loopback"`, so `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored and `req.ip` is the same for every client. As a result:
- every unauthenticated route (public map, health) shares one global 600/min bucket, which a single client can exhaust for everyone (DoS);
- the "ip ceiling" becomes a global 3000/min per route.

This leaves the A-C1 fix incomplete in the only deployed topology. It is currently deferred as a post-deploy check in VALIDATION.md, but the shipped default is wrong for the documented setup.
**Fix:** Before relying on this in production, confirm `req.ip` on the VPS, for example by logging the peer address once at startup. If it is the gateway, ship `TRUST_PROXY=loopback,uniquelocal` in `infra/vps/env.example` as an active line, not commented out. Caddy already overwrites incoming `X-Forwarded-For`. Alternatively, run the API with `network_mode: host`, or disable `userland-proxy`.

### WR-06: Pending remote deletions are not counted as unsynced, so logout and account switch silently drop them

**File:** `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.ts:81-101`
**Issue:** `queueDeleteSurvey` deletes the `local_surveys` row and leaves only a `sync_queue` entry (`mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts:233-249`). `countUnsyncedLocalWork` counts `local_surveys` rows plus `id IN (SELECT survey_id FROM sync_queue)`, so a queued delete whose survey row is gone counts as zero. The same is true for queued attachment deletes. This has two consequences:
- `handleLogout` purges without the D-03 warning.
- `resolveLocalDataOwnership` returns `"purge-and-adopt"` instead of `"conflict"`.

Either way the delete never reaches the server. A survey the user deleted, which may be public, stays published.
**Fix:** Count pending queue rows separately, for example `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT survey_id) FROM sync_queue` added to the survey count, or a third `pendingOperations` field in `UnsyncedLocalWork`. Include them in `hasUnsyncedWork` and in the dialog text.

### WR-07: If the owner check fails, sync is suspended permanently with no retry and the wrong message

**File:** `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts:90-94`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.ts:47-51`
**Issue:** Any exception in `recheck`, such as a transient SQLite error, sets `status = "error"`, which makes `syncAllowed` false. Nothing calls `recheck` again until the `sub` changes, and `recheck` is not exposed to the UI. Auto-sync then stays off for the rest of the app session. A manual sync reports "des relevés locaux appartiennent à un autre compte", which is false. Field data silently stops syncing.
**Fix:** Retry `recheck` with backoff on `"error"` and on app foreground. Use a separate status message for `"error"` and `"checking"`, for example "Vérification des données locales…", and reserve `OWNER_SUSPENDED_MESSAGE` for `"conflict"`.

### WR-08: A sync still in flight during logout writes the previous user's data after the purge

**File:** `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts:133-143`
**Issue:** `performLogoutAndPurge` does not wait for or cancel a running `syncPending` or `pullRemoteChanges`: `syncInProgressRef` is not consulted. A drain that started before logout keeps its captured token. After `clearLocalIbpData()` it can still insert pulled surveys and attachments and move the downsync cursor. Those rows now have no owner marker, so the next account to log in gets `"adopt"` and sees the previous user's surveys in its local list. That is a cross-account exposure on shared devices.
**Fix:** Expose a way to cancel or await in-flight sync from `useSurveySyncNetwork`, for example an `awaitIdle()` promise or an abort flag checked between queue items and pull pages. Await it before `clearLocalIbpData()`, and run the purge again if a write landed afterwards.

## Info

### IN-01: The debug gate fails open when `NODE_ENV` is unset

**File:** `api/src/debug/debug-gating.ts:15-17`
**Issue:** `NODE_ENV !== "production"` loads DebugModule for any deployment that forgets `NODE_ENV`, for example running `node dist/main.js` on a staging host. The Dockerfile and compose file set it, and inner guards exist, but the outer layer is allow-by-default.
**Fix:** Consider `["test","development"].includes(env.NODE_ENV ?? "")`, which still works with CI's `NODE_ENV=test`, and logging at startup whether the debug surface is mounted.

### IN-02: An empty `CORS_ORIGIN` reflects any origin with `credentials: true`

**File:** `api/src/app.setup.ts:19-24`
**Issue:** `infra/vps/env.example` sets `CORS_ORIGIN=` with the comment "Empty: only the native mobile app consumes the API". Because `""` is falsy, the code uses `origin: true`, which reflects every origin with credentials. This was moved rather than introduced here. Impact is limited because auth uses Bearer tokens, not cookies, but it is the opposite of what the comment intends.
**Fix:** Treat empty as `origin: false`.

### IN-03: `clearLocalIbpData` issues several DELETEs without a transaction

**File:** `mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts:432-442`
**Issue:** If the app is killed partway through, it can leave surveys with no queue, or data with the owner marker already removed. The next login would then adopt the leftovers.
**Fix:** Wrap the statements in `db.withTransactionAsync`.

### IN-04: `discardForeignData` and `handleLogout` errors become unhandled promise rejections

**File:** `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts:146,184`, `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts:100-111`
**Issue:** `void localDataOwner.discardForeignData()` has no catch. A SQLite failure leaves the conflict screen showing without any feedback. `countUnsyncedLocalWork()` in `handleLogout` is also uncaught.
**Fix:** Add a try/catch that calls `setStatus` with an error message.

### IN-05: Tests restore `process.env` values by assigning possibly `undefined` originals

**File:** `api/test/auth.guard.spec.ts:48`, `api/test/debug-surface.spec.ts:68-69`
**Issue:** In Node, `process.env.X = undefined` stores the string `"undefined"`, so an unset `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` becomes the truthy secret `"undefined"` for later tests in the same context.
**Fix:** `if (original === undefined) delete process.env.X; else process.env.X = original`.
