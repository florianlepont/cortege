provides:

  - "mobile/src/app/id-token.ts: extractIdTokenClaims for reading Auth0 sub/email off the ID token without verification"
  - "useAuth0Session hook that never ends the session on a network/timeout/unknown credentials error, forces a real refresh on 401, and exposes sessionOwner"
  - "renderHook test recipe (@testing-library/react-native/pure + jest.mock('react-native', ...)) for the rest of this phase's mobile test tasks"

  patterns:
    - "renderHook tests import from '@testing-library/react-native/pure' (not the main entry) and jest.mock('react-native', factory) before that import, because the current mobile Jest config (ts-jest, testEnvironment node) cannot parse the real react-native package"
    - "Pure error-classification functions (auth-errors.ts, id-token.ts) live outside the hook so they can be unit-tested without renderHook"

key-decisions:

  - "sessionOwner is set from extractIdTokenClaims on every successful credential fetch (restore, login, register, forgot-password, refresh) so plan 07/08 can compare it against local_meta's owner marker"
  - "ensureAccessToken removed from the hook's return object — grep-confirmed no consumer existed outside the hook itself"

patterns-established:
  - "renderHook + jest.mock('react-native', ...) + '@testing-library/react-native/pure' recipe, documented in render-hook-smoke.test.ts, to be reused by every later renderHook test in this phase and generalized in Phase 1.3"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 03: Stop the useAuth0Session credential-error data-loss bug (M-C1) Summary

**Both credential call sites in `useAuth0Session` (mid-session refresh and app-launch restore) now classify `CredentialsManagerError.type` instead of swallowing every error into `clearSession()`; a 401 forces a real token refresh via the SDK's 4th `forceRefresh` argument; the hook exposes the Auth0 `sub`/`email` of the current session for the owner check landing in a later plan.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T14:55:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23T15:03:01Z
- **Tasks:** 3 completed
- **Files modified:** 9 (2 created test-infra, 4 created source+test pairs, 1 created hook test, 2 modified: hook + lockfile/package.json)

## Accomplishments
- Root cause of audit finding M-C1 fixed at both call sites (`getValidAccessToken` and the session-restore effect) — a network error, timeout, or unknown error can no longer end the session or reach the purge path, at launch or mid-session
- A 401 from the API now forces a genuine credential refresh (`getCredentials(undefined, undefined, undefined, true)`) instead of silently reusing the cached token
- `sessionOwner` (Auth0 `sub` + `email`, decoded from the ID token) is now available from the hook for the "local data owned by another account" check (D-04, later plans)
- `renderHook` proven to work under the existing mobile Jest config via the `/pure` entry point + a `react-native` factory mock — unblocks every subsequent renderHook-based test in this phase and Phase 1.3

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Install RNTL + test-renderer and prove renderHook runs** - `2754b0e` (test)
2. **Task 2: Pure helpers — credentials error classification and ID-token claims (TDD)** - `21b6a69` (test, RED) → `d2da251` (feat, GREEN)
3. **Task 3: Classify both credential call sites in useAuth0Session, force refresh on 401, expose session owner (TDD)** - `11a2322` (test, RED) → `643be3f` (feat, GREEN)

**Plan metadata:** committed separately below (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/hooks/render-hook-smoke.test.ts` - renderHook recipe reference test (2 passing cases)
- `mobile/src/hooks/auth-errors.ts` - `classifyCredentialsError`, `AUTH_REQUIRED_ERROR`, `AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE_ERROR`, `isAuthRequiredError`, `isAuthTemporarilyUnavailableError`
- `mobile/src/hooks/auth-errors.test.ts` - 12 tests covering every `CredentialsManagerErrorCodes` value plus non-SDK errors
- `mobile/src/app/id-token.ts` - `extractIdTokenClaims` (base64url decode, UTF-8 safe, no signature verification)
- `mobile/src/app/id-token.test.ts` - 10 tests including non-ASCII email and malformed-token cases
- `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts` - both call sites now classify errors; `getValidAccessToken` never returns null; `withAuthRetry` forces a refresh on 401; `sessionOwner` state added; `ensureAccessToken` removed from the return object
- `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.test.ts` - 10 renderHook tests: 6 restore-effect scenarios (NO_NETWORK, RENEW_FAILED online/offline, NO_CREDENTIALS, plain timeout, successful restore exposing sessionOwner) + 4 withAuthRetry scenarios
- `mobile/package.json`, `package-lock.json` - `@testing-library/react-native@14.0.1`, `test-renderer@1.3.0` added as mobile-workspace-only devDependencies

## Decisions Made
- Followed D-01/D-01a exactly: `RENEW_FAILED` ends the session only when `isDeviceOnline()` resolves true; any exception from the network check itself is treated as offline (the safe side — retry later, never end the session on an ambiguous signal)
- Kept `refreshSessionTokens`'s existing name/return shape (`{ accessToken, refreshToken: "" } | null`) as instructed — plan 06 changes its consumers
- Used `@testing-library/react-native/pure` (not the main entry) for every renderHook test in this plan, since the main entry's auto-cleanup/matcher wiring pulls in more `react-native` surface than the current Jest config (ts-jest, testEnvironment node, no react-native moduleNameMapper) can parse — documented in `render-hook-smoke.test.ts` for later plans to copy

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. `getValidAccessToken`'s implementation restructures the try/catch slightly from the plan's inline description (hoists `credentialsManager` into a local to keep the `forceRefresh` call on one line for the acceptance-criteria grep and Prettier's 100-column limit), with identical behavior.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- render-hook-smoke` — 2/2 passing
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- auth-errors id-token` — 22/22 passing
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- useAuth0Session` — 10/10 passing
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` (full suite) — 30 suites, 402/402 passing
- `npm --workspace mobile run typecheck` — clean
- `npm --workspace mobile run lint` — clean
- `npm run typecheck` (root, mobile + api) — clean
- `npm run format:check` — clean for all tracked repo files (unrelated `.claude/` GSD-tooling warnings only, per environment notes)
- `git diff --quiet mobile/jest.unit.config.js` — unchanged, as required

All acceptance-criteria greps from the plan pass:
- `classifyCredentialsError(` appears 2× in `useAuth0Session.ts` (refresh path, restore path)
- `getCredentials(undefined, undefined, undefined, true)` appears exactly once
- `getValidAccessToken`'s body contains zero `return null`
- `sessionOwner` appears 4× (declaration, restore-effect local, return object, plus the state-setter's argument name)
- `ensureAccessToken` has zero remaining references anywhere in `mobile/src` or `mobile/App.tsx`
- `mobile/package.json`/root `package.json` dependency assertions from the plan both pass

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None — this plan closes T-01.2-11 and T-01.2-12 from the plan's own threat model exactly as scoped; no new network endpoint, auth path, or schema change was introduced.

## Self-Check: PASSED
