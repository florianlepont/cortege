# Phase 01.2: Code Review Fix Report

**Fixed at:** 2026-09-23
**Source review:** .planning/phases/03-stop-field-data-loss-and-account-exposure/03-REVIEW.md
**Iteration:** 1

**Summary:**
- Findings in scope: 9 (CR-01, WR-01 … WR-08; fix scope critical_warning, Info findings IN-01 … IN-05 not addressed)
- Fixed: 9
- Skipped: 0

Every fix has a regression test that was run against the unfixed code and failed before the fix was applied. Mobile tests are `*.test.ts`, and renderHook tests use `afterEach(async () => { await cleanup() })`.

Quality gate after the last commit:
- `npm run lint`: pass
- `npm run typecheck`: pass
- `npm run test:unit`: pass (API 98, mobile 497)
- API E2E with CI's env: 7 suites, 54 tests pass
- `npm run format:check`: the only warnings are in untracked `.claude/` tooling

Fixes were committed directly on `claude/code-audit-complete-3sn99m`, as instructed. No review-fix worktree or temp branch was created, and no recovery sentinel was written.

## Fixed Issues

### CR-01: `syncAllowed` stays "ok" for the previous account when the session owner changes from A to B

**Status:** fixed: requires human verification (state-handling logic)
**Files modified:** `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/sync-owner-guard.ts` (new), `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts`, tests `mobile/src/hooks/sync-owner-gate.test.ts` (new), `useAuth0Session.test.ts`, `useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts`, `useSurveySync.test.ts`
**Commit:** 55b1543
**Applied fix:**
- `useLocalDataOwner` records the Auth0 `sub` that the owner check approved, in both state and a ref. `syncAllowed` is `status === "ok" && approvedSub === sessionOwner.sub`, so the render that switches A to B is already false.
- A stale check can no longer approve a newer session.
- New `ensureSyncOwner(tokenSub)` re-reads `getLocalDataOwner()`. It passes only when the token's sub, the session sub, the approved sub and the stored owner all match.
- `withAuthRetry` now passes the token's `sub` to the operation.
- `runSync`, `maybeAutoSync` and `handlePullChanges` call `assertSyncOwner` inside `withAuthRetry`, immediately before `syncPending` / `pullRemoteChanges`. This also covers the forced-refresh retry after a 401.
- The renderHook regression test reproduced the bug before the fix: `syncPending` was called with B's token against A's queue.

### WR-01: Visibility toggle and attachment deletion drain the whole sync queue without the owner gate

**Status:** fixed: requires human verification (gating logic)
**Files modified:** `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts`
**Commit:** c8f7169
**Applied fix:**
- `updateSurveyVisibility` is now called queue-only, with an empty token (its documented "queued locally" branch). When `syncAllowed` is true, the hook then drains the queue through `withAuthRetry` + `assertSyncOwner`. Otherwise the change stays queued, with a message saying sync is waiting for the owner check.
- `handleDeleteAttachment` does the same.
- `handleSubmitSurvey` is gated the same way. It sends a local survey id under the current token, so D-04 applies to it too.
- The 401 refresh that `refreshSessionTokens` used to do is now handled by `withAuthRetry`, so that parameter was dropped from this hook.

### WR-02: A concurrent first login with an unverified email gets a 401

**Status:** fixed: requires human verification (concurrency logic; covered by real-DB E2E)
**Files modified:** `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts`, `api/test/auth.guard.spec.ts`, `api/test/auth-provisioning.e2e-spec.ts` (new)
**Commit:** ec82db8
**Applied fix:**
- Removed the `SELECT … WHERE email` pre-check. Provisioning now inserts first (`ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)`) and then classifies a 23505 from the email index.
- It re-selects by `auth0_sub`. If the row is its twin's, it returns that user. Otherwise the email belongs to another account and the request is refused.
- The real-PostgreSQL E2E test runs two concurrent first logins for the same sub, with the second `/userinfo` delayed. It covers both an unverified email and no email claim. Before the fix it failed with "Refusing to link…".

### WR-03: Verified-email linking overwrites an `auth0_sub` that is already set

**Files modified:** `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts`, `api/test/auth.guard.spec.ts`, `api/test/auth-provisioning.e2e-spec.ts`, `api/test/auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts`
**Commits:** 74b4b8f, 77365e0
**Applied fix:**
- The linking UPDATE now requires `AND auth0_sub IS NULL`. A verified email that matches an account linked to another sub falls through to the INSERT, trips the email index and is refused.
- The E2E tests cover:
  - linking an unlinked account;
  - no re-pointing, with the original identity still resolving;
  - a verified race for the same sub.
- 77365e0 updates `auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts`, which had encoded the old re-pointing behaviour.

### WR-04: Refusing provisioning returns 401, so the client force-refreshes tokens on every request

**Files modified:** `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts`, `api/test/auth.guard.spec.ts`, `api/test/auth-provisioning.e2e-spec.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/auth-errors.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/auth-errors.test.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.test.ts`, `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md`
**Commit:** aff5938
**Applied fix:**
- The refusal throws `ForbiddenException({ statusCode: 403, error: "Forbidden", code: "email_already_linked", message })`. `canActivate` rethrows it; every other failure stays a 401.
- Mobile: `isEmailAlreadyLinkedError` matches a 403 with that code. `handleLogin`, `handleRegister` and `handleForgotPassword` show a French message, clear the refused credentials and clear the session, so no heartbeat keeps calling the API.
- `withAuthRetry` refreshes only on 401. A test confirms that a 403 is rethrown without `forceRefresh`.
- Installed apps: their `withAuthRetry` also refreshes only on 401, so the refresh loop stops for them too. Their login shows "Login error: This email address already belongs to another account".
- `api-contract-v1.md` documents the linking rules and the 403 body.

### WR-05: With the default `TRUST_PROXY=loopback`, production keys every request on the Docker bridge gateway

**Files modified:** `api/src/app.setup.ts`, `api/.env.example`, `infra/vps/env.example`, `api/test/app-setup.spec.ts` (new)
**Commit:** ebc9084
**Applied fix:**
- The default trust proxy is now `loopback,uniquelocal`. The comment explains why: Docker's userland proxy relays the loopback-published port, so the container sees the bridge gateway as the peer.
- Both env examples ship `TRUST_PROXY=loopback,uniquelocal` as an active line.
- The new spec checks the compiled Express trust function with a real Nest app: the gateway is trusted, loopback is trusted, a public peer is not, and the override still works.
- The post-deploy check of `req.ip` on the VPS (already listed in VALIDATION.md) is still recommended.

### WR-06: Pending remote deletions are not counted as unsynced

**Files modified:** `mobile/src/app/local-data-owner.ts`, `mobile/src/app/local-data-owner.test.ts`, `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.ts`, `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.test.ts`, `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.sqlite.test.ts` (new), `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` (new), `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts`
**Commit:** d7e0f83
**Applied fix:**
- `UnsyncedLocalWork` gains `deletions`, the number of distinct queued survey ids that have no `local_surveys` row. It is included in `hasUnsyncedWork` and shown in the dialog summary ("N suppressions en attente").
- The regression test runs the real SQL and the real `queueDeleteSurvey` through `node:sqlite`, behind an expo-sqlite-shaped adapter (Node 22, as in CI). Before the fix, the delete counted as nothing, and an account switch resolved to purge-and-adopt instead of conflict.

### WR-07: If the owner check fails, sync is suspended permanently with no retry and the wrong message

**Status:** fixed: requires human verification (retry/state logic)
**Files modified:** `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.test.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/sync-owner-gate.test.ts`
**Commit:** 39109ea
**Applied fix:**
- An "error" status is retried automatically with exponential backoff: 2 s, doubling up to 60 s. The counter resets when a new session starts or the check reaches a decision.
- A manual sync or pull, or a new token (auth-ready), also retries a failed check.
- "des relevés locaux appartiennent à un autre compte" is now shown only for "conflict". For checking, error and idle, the app shows "Vérification des données locales en cours… La synchronisation reprendra ensuite."

### WR-08: A sync still in flight during logout writes the previous user's data after the purge

**Status:** fixed: requires human verification (concurrency logic)
**Files modified:** `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/sync-activity.ts` (new), `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/sync-activity.test.ts` (new), `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` (new), `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts`, and their tests
**Commit:** 82ef8b2
**Applied fix:**
- A new sync-activity tracker wraps every `syncPending` / `pullRemoteChanges` call: in the network hook and in the visibility and attachment-delete paths.
- Logout now suspends sync, signs out, waits for in-flight tasks, and only then purges. New syncs are refused with `SYNC_SUSPENDED` until the purge ends.
- The owner check's purge-and-adopt, `discardForeignData` and the debug reset purge the same way. A pull still writing the previous account's data therefore always finishes before the purge, and cannot be adopted by the next account.
- The renderHook test on the real `useSurveySync` failed before the fix: the purge ran while the sync was still in flight, and a manual sync started mid-purge.
- In `useSurveySync.test.ts`, the microtask flush helper was raised from 5 to 20 turns, because the purge now takes a few more async hops.

## Notes for the reviewer

- **Pending deletions in the dialogs.** The logout and discard dialogs reuse the existing sentence "… seront définitivement supprimé(e)s de cet appareil". When only deletions are pending, the real loss is that the server deletion never happens. The wording may deserve a UX pass.
- **`node:sqlite` in the mobile unit tests.** It prints an ExperimentalWarning on Node 22. CI uses Node 22, so the test runs there.
