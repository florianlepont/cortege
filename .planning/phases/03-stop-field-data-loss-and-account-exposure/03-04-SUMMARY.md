# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.2-01
    provides: renderHook / hook-testing conventions used elsewhere in this phase
provides:
  - Shared bbox formatter (buildBboxAroundPoint) reused by map viewport and nearby-parcels queries
  - shouldShowDevTools() gate hiding developer tools and the stored API URL override from production builds
affects: [01.2-09 (device verification), 01.6-01.9 (mobile hygiene lots)]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Extract a small `.test.ts`-coverable predicate (shouldShowDevTools) instead of gating with a raw __DEV__ check inline, so a pure Jest test can pin the production behavior without a component renderer"
    - "Share bbox math via a private formatBbox() helper so both computeRegionBbox and buildBboxAroundPoint stay byte-identical in formatting/clamping"

key-decisions:
  - "buildBboxAroundPoint reuses computeRegionBbox's private formatBbox() helper rather than duplicating the toFixed(6)/clamping logic (D-12)"
  - "shouldShowDevTools(isDev = __DEV__) takes an explicit override parameter so it is trivially unit-testable without mocking a global; default reads the real __DEV__ (D-11)"

patterns-established:
  - "New `.test.ts` files continue the React.useState/useCallback spy pattern (not renderHook) established in useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts for hooks with no other RNTL dependency in this wave"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 04: Mobile bbox fix and dev-tools production gating Summary

**Nearby-parcels queries now send `minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat` via a formatter shared with the map viewport, and developer tools (API URL override, data-reset buttons) are compiled out of production behavior through a single testable `shouldShowDevTools()` gate.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T15:07:40Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23T15:10:16Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed (both TDD)
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments
- Fixed audit finding M-H3: `useNearbyParcels` previously sent bbox as `minLng,maxLng,minLat,maxLat` (reversed order relative to the API contract); it now calls `buildBboxAroundPoint({ lat, lng }, RADIUS_DEG)`, sharing the exact clamping/formatting logic already proven correct in `computeRegionBbox`
- Fixed audit finding M-H5: the "Outils développeur" section (API URL override + two data-reset buttons) in `SettingsScreen.tsx` is now rendered only when `shouldShowDevTools()` is true; `App.tsx` also stops loading a previously stored API URL override at startup in production builds, closing the "redirect a production build to another server" attack surface (T-01.2-14, T-01.2-15)
- Both fixes are covered by regression tests that pin the exact expected bbox string and the exact `__DEV__`-gated boolean, following the RED→GREEN TDD cycle (test commits precede feat commits in git history)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically, following the RED/GREEN TDD cycle:

1. **Task 1: Shared bbox helper and nearby-parcels bbox order fix**
   - `f7c199d` (test) — failing tests for `buildBboxAroundPoint` and the `useNearbyParcels` bbox-order regression
   - `8d3d588` (feat) — `formatBbox`/`buildBboxAroundPoint` extraction in `map-viewport.ts`; `useNearbyParcels.ts` now calls it
2. **Task 2: Dev tools only in `__DEV__` builds**
   - `7597e3c` (test) — failing test for `shouldShowDevTools`
   - `197fcba` (feat) — `dev-tools.ts` predicate; `SettingsScreen.tsx` and `App.tsx` gated on it

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/app/map-viewport.ts` - added private `formatBbox()` and exported `buildBboxAroundPoint(center, radiusDeg)`; `computeRegionBbox` now delegates to `formatBbox` with unchanged output
- `mobile/src/app/map-viewport.test.ts` - added `buildBboxAroundPoint` describe block (center point, NE and SW world-edge clamping)
- `mobile/src/hooks/useNearbyParcels.ts` - bbox construction now calls `buildBboxAroundPoint` instead of a hand-rolled, incorrectly-ordered string
- `mobile/src/hooks/useNearbyParcels.test.ts` - new; mocks `expo-location` and `../api/ibp-api`, spies on `React.useState`/`useCallback` (no renderer), asserts the exact bbox sent and that permission-denied skips the fetch
- `mobile/src/app/dev-tools.ts` - new; exports `shouldShowDevTools(isDev = __DEV__)`
- `mobile/src/app/dev-tools.test.ts` - new; three cases (explicit false, explicit true, default under Jest's `__DEV__: true`)
- `mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` - wraps the "Outils développeur" `AppCollapsibleSection` in `{shouldShowDevTools() ? (...) : null}`
- `mobile/App.tsx` - the `loadStoredApiUrl()` effect returns early when `!shouldShowDevTools()`

## Decisions Made
- Reused the existing `computeRegionBbox` clamping/formatting logic via a private `formatBbox()` helper rather than writing a second, parallel bbox formatter — guarantees the two functions can never drift out of sync (D-12).
- `shouldShowDevTools` takes an explicit optional parameter defaulting to `__DEV__` specifically so the "does it read `__DEV__` by default" behavior itself is unit-testable, per the plan's `.test.ts` (not `.test.tsx`) constraint.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None. The RED phase for both tasks was verified by temporarily reverting the implementation file to its pre-plan state (via `git show HEAD:...`), confirming the new tests failed for the expected reasons (reversed bbox order for `useNearbyParcels`; missing export for `buildBboxAroundPoint` and `dev-tools`), then reapplying the implementation and confirming GREEN — this produced a clean test-then-feat commit pair per task despite the implementation for Task 1 having been drafted before the RED check.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 01.2-05 (rate limiting / debug surface / identity fixes on the API side) is independent of this plan and can proceed
- Manual verification item from `03-VALIDATION.md` ("Settings shows no 'Outils développeur' section in a release build") remains to be exercised on-device, tracked for plan 01.2-09
- No blockers introduced
