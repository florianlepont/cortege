requires: []
provides:
  - "Client-aware rate limiting: per-token buckets, trusted-XFF client IP fallback, and a per-IP ceiling that stops fake-token rotation"
  - "configureApp(app) shared bootstrap (trust proxy + helmet + CORS + prefix + validation pipe) reused by main.ts and E2E specs"
  - "Route-level @Throttle overrides for /sync POST and the three upload routes"
affects: [01.2-05 (DebugModule gating touches app.module.ts imports adjacent to this plan's ThrottlerModule change)]

tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "configureApp(app: NestExpressApplication) as the single bootstrap function shared between main.ts and E2E TestingModule apps, so trust-proxy/CORS/prefix/validation never drift between runtime and tests"
    - "Named @nestjs/throttler throttlers (\"default\", \"ip\") with a resolvable limit function so NODE_ENV is read per-request, not baked in at module-load time"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 01: Client-aware rate limiting Summary

**Rate limiting now keys on SHA-256(bearer token) or trusted client IP instead of the shared proxy address, with production limits raised from 10/min for everyone to 600/min per client (60/min on /sync, 240/min on uploads) plus a 3000/min per-IP ceiling against token rotation.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 45 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T14:34:42Z (session start per STATE.md; plan executed in a single continuous session)
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23
- **Tasks:** 3/3
- **Files modified:** 13 (6 created, 7 modified)

## Accomplishments
- Fixed audit finding A-C1: one field device syncing offline data could previously 429 every other user, because the global `ThrottlerGuard` keyed on `req.ip` behind Caddy (the proxy address) with a 10/min production ceiling.
- New `ClientAwareThrottlerGuard` keys on a SHA-256 hash of the bearer token when present, falling back to the real client IP (via Express `trust proxy`) otherwise — verified with unit tests and an E2E spec that two different tokens behind the same proxy get independent buckets.
- Added a second named "ip" throttler with its own ceiling (3000/min in production) so rotating fake bearer tokens from one IP cannot bypass per-token limiting — proven by an E2E test where the sixth rotated-token request from the same IP gets a 429.
- Extracted `configureApp(app)` so the E2E rate-limit spec exercises the exact same trust-proxy/CORS/prefix/validation bootstrap as the real server, closing the gap where an E2E test could pass against different bootstrap config than production.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rate-limit configuration and client-aware throttler guard (TDD)**
   - `defffc3` (test) — failing specs for `rate-limit.config.ts` and `throttler.guard.ts`
   - `e3a3641` (feat) — implementation; 12/12 unit tests passing
2. **Task 2: Wire trust proxy, the custom guard and route-level throttles** - `8026463` (feat)
3. **Task 3: E2E proof of per-client buckets, XFF keying and IP ceiling (TDD)** - `7287139` (test)

**Plan metadata:** pending (docs: complete plan) — added after this summary is written.

## Files Created/Modified
- `api/src/common/rate-limit.config.ts` - Throttle constants, `resolveThrottleLimit`, `buildThrottlerOptions`, `SYNC_THROTTLE`, `UPLOAD_THROTTLE`
- `api/src/auth/throttler.guard.ts` - `clientTracker`, `ipTracker`, `ClientAwareThrottlerGuard`
- `api/src/app.setup.ts` - `configureApp(app)` shared bootstrap (trust proxy, helmet, CORS, `/v1` prefix, validation pipe)
- `api/src/main.ts` - Uses `NestExpressApplication` + `configureApp(app)`; bootstrap code moved to `app.setup.ts`
- `api/src/app.module.ts` - `ThrottlerModule.forRoot(buildThrottlerOptions())`; `APP_GUARD` is now `ClientAwareThrottlerGuard`
- `api/src/surveys/sync.controller.ts` - `@Throttle(SYNC_THROTTLE)` on `POST /sync`
- `api/src/surveys/surveys.controller.ts` - `@Throttle(UPLOAD_THROTTLE)` on `POST :id/attachments` and `PUT :id/attachments/:attachmentId/upload`
- `api/src/users/users.controller.ts` - `@Throttle(UPLOAD_THROTTLE)` on `PUT me/profile-picture`
- `api/.env.example`, `infra/vps/env.example` - documented `TRUST_PROXY` override
- `api/test/rate-limit.config.spec.ts`, `api/test/throttler.guard.spec.ts` - unit coverage (12 tests)
- `api/test/rate-limit.e2e-spec.ts` - E2E coverage (3 tests): per-token buckets, XFF keying, IP ceiling

## Decisions Made
- Tracker key = SHA-256(bearer token) when present, else client IP — matches D-05 exactly; `req.user` is confirmed unreachable at global-guard time (RESEARCH Pitfall 2), so no guard reordering was attempted.
- Exact throttle values (600/60/240/3000 in production, 10000 everywhere else) are Claude's discretion per D-06, sized for one device draining a full offline day's sync queue with a 15s auto-sync cooldown, plus two upload calls per photo.
- `trust proxy` defaults to `"loopback"` per D-05; the optional `TRUST_PROXY` env var is documented but left unset by default, since only Caddy proxies to the API today.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All acceptance-criteria greps (createHash count, absence of req.user/jwt references, config values, decorator counts, DebugModule import unchanged, TRUST_PROXY documentation) passed on first check.

## Issues Encountered
- The E2E spec initially typed `app` as `INestApplication`, which `configureApp(app: NestExpressApplication)` rejects (`.set()` etc. missing from the interface). Fixed by typing `app` as `NestExpressApplication` in both `describe` blocks — a one-line TypeScript fix caught immediately by `tsc` during the first E2E run, not a design issue.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. `TRUST_PROXY` is an optional env var documented in both `.env.example` files; the default (`"loopback"`) requires no action.

## Next Phase Readiness
- `api/src/app.module.ts`'s `DebugModule` import line is untouched (confirmed via `git diff`), leaving it ready for Phase 01.2 plan 05 (`REQ-AUD-debug-surface`) to gate it on `NODE_ENV`.
- Full API test suite green: `npm --workspace api run test:unit` (78 tests, 8 suites) and `npm --workspace api run test:e2e` (39 tests, 5 suites, including the new `rate-limit.e2e-spec.ts`), plus `npm --workspace api run build` and `npm --workspace api run lint`.
- No blockers for subsequent 01.2 plans.
