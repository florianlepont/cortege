  - "useSurveySyncNetwork retry-later handling for AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE in sync, pull and report"
  - "useAuth0Session/useSurveySync/useSurveySyncNetwork/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations with the pre-Auth0 stubs (refreshToken, pendingEmailVerification, devVerificationToken, handleVerifyEmail, handleResendVerification, handleCancelEmailVerification) fully removed"

    - "Auth gating on the sync hooks now checks accessToken alone (single source of truth); refreshSessionTokens returns { accessToken } with no stub refreshToken field"
    - "auth-errors.ts predicates (isAuthRequiredError/isAuthTemporarilyUnavailableError) are the single place hooks classify a thrown Error(\"AUTH_REQUIRED\"|\"AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE\") — useSurveySyncNetwork and useSurveySyncSurveyOperations import from auth-errors directly instead of re-exporting through useAuth0Session"

key-decisions:
  - "clearSurveySessionState (the onSessionCleared callback passed to useAuth0Session) now only resets React state (surveyDetails, surveyEvents, the detail auto-load cooldown ref) — the clearLocalIbpData() call is gone; resetLocalSurveyState (debug reset) is untouched and still purges explicitly"
  - "AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE never calls clearSession in runSync, maybeAutoSync's pull branch, handlePullChanges or handleReportSurvey; each surfaces a French 'retry later' status instead"
  - "refreshSessionTokens' return shape changed from { accessToken, refreshToken: \"\" } to { accessToken }; useSurveySyncSurveyOperations' handleToggleVisibility retry path and its type signature were updated to match"

# Phase 01.2 Plan 06: Remove the session-cleared purge and pre-Auth0 stubs Summary

**`clearSurveySessionState` no longer calls `clearLocalIbpData`, `useSurveySyncNetwork`'s sync/pull/report paths treat `AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE` as "retry later" instead of ending the session, and the six pre-Auth0 stub fields (`refreshToken`, `pendingEmailVerification`, `devVerificationToken`, `handleVerifyEmail`, `handleResendVerification`, `handleCancelEmailVerification`) are gone from `useAuth0Session` and every caller.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 22 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T15:04:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23T15:26:23Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 8 (4 source, 4 test)

## Accomplishments
- D-02 closed: a genuine session end (whether AUTH_REQUIRED or a RENEW_FAILED-while-online rejection) resets only UI state — `local_surveys`, `sync_queue` and `local_attachments` survive and sync after re-login with the same account
- A temporary auth failure (`AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE`) during a manual/auto sync, a pull, or a report submission no longer ends the session; each path shows a French "retry later" status and leaves `clearSession` uncalled
- All six pre-Auth0 stub fields removed from `useAuth0Session`'s return object and from every consumer (`useSurveySync`, and the two sub-hooks that received `refreshToken` as a param); grep-confirmed zero remaining non-test references
- `refreshSessionTokens` narrowed to `{ accessToken } | null`, and every auth-gating check across the sync hooks (`accessToken || refreshToken`) collapsed to a single `accessToken` check

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove the session-cleared purge and the pre-Auth0 stubs; handle retry-later** - `394c873` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Update and extend the hook tests for the new contract** - `f9dc324` (test)

**Plan metadata:** committed separately below (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts` - removed the six stub fields and `refreshToken: ""`; `refreshSessionTokens` now returns `{ accessToken } | null`
- `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.test.ts` - added a "stub removal" assertion and two `refreshSessionTokens` behavior tests (success shape, null on AUTH_REQUIRED)
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts` - `clearSurveySessionState` drops the `clearLocalIbpData()` call with a D-02 comment; stopped destructuring/returning the six stub keys and stopped passing `refreshToken` to the two sub-hooks
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts` - mock object no longer carries the stub keys (added `sessionOwner: null`); new tests assert `clearLocalIbpData` is never called via `onSessionCleared` and that the hook's return value has no stub properties
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.ts` - dropped the `refreshToken` param; imports `isAuthRequiredError`/`isAuthTemporarilyUnavailableError` from `../auth-errors`; `runSync`, `maybeAutoSync`'s pull branch, `handlePullChanges` and `handleReportSurvey` each gained a retry-later branch ahead of the AUTH_REQUIRED branch; all `accessToken || refreshToken` gating collapsed to `accessToken`
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncNetwork.test.ts` - removed the `refreshToken` param and the stub `useAuth0Session` mock (now mocks `react-native-auth0` minimally so `auth-errors.ts` resolves); added three `AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE` tests (sync, pull, report) asserting `clearSession` is not called
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts` - dropped `refreshToken` param and updated `refreshSessionTokens`'s type to `() => Promise<{ accessToken: string } | null>`; `handleToggleVisibility`'s `accessToken || refreshToken` check collapsed to `accessToken`; both `AUTH_REQUIRED_ERROR` string comparisons switched to `isAuthRequiredError`
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts` - removed `refreshToken` from params, updated the `refreshSessionTokens` mock to `{ accessToken: "new-token" }`, and mocked `react-native-auth0` minimally

## Decisions Made
- Kept `handleLogout` behavior unchanged in this plan (it still calls `clearSession()` unconditionally after Auth0 logout) — plan 08 adds the explicit confirm-then-purge flow, and between plans 06/08 logout keeping local data is the safe direction, exactly as the plan's objective specified
- Used a module-level `RETRY_LATER_MESSAGE` constant in `useSurveySyncNetwork.ts` for the sync/pull "Synchronisation reportée…" status so the wording is defined once and reused across `runSync` and `maybeAutoSync`'s pull branch; `handleReportSurvey` uses its own distinct message per the plan's exact wording
- Mocked `react-native-auth0` minimally (empty `CredentialsManagerErrorCodes`, a bare `CredentialsManagerError` class) in the two survey-sync test files that now transitively import `auth-errors.ts`, rather than mocking `auth-errors.ts` itself — keeps the real predicate logic under test as the plan's interface notes suggested ("auth-errors is a pure module and can be imported for real")

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. All required greps and the acceptance criteria from both tasks pass as specified.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 07/08 (D-04 owner check, D-03 logout confirmation) can build directly on `sessionOwner` (from plan 03) and the now-unpurged local data path from this plan
- Full mobile suite green: 32 suites / 418 tests; `lint`, `typecheck`, and `prettier --check` on touched files all clean

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files created/modified confirmed on disk; both task commits (`394c873`, `f9dc324`) confirmed in git log.
