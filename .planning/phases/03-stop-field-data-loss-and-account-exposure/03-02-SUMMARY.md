# Phase 01.2 Plan 02: Close identity and report-privacy audit findings Summary

**Auth0 account linking now requires `email_verified === true`, first-login provisioning is race-free via `ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)`, and the `reported` survey event carries no reporter identity or reason.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-23T14:45:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-23T15:40:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 9 (1 created, 8 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `AuthGuard.getOrProvisionUser` rewritten: unverified emails can no longer take over an existing account (A-H1); verified social logins (Google/Apple) still link as before
- Concurrent first logins for the same Auth0 `sub` converge on exactly one `users` row via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)` with a `23505` fallback re-select
- `ReportsService.createReport` stops writing `actor_id`/`reason` into `survey_events`; the survey owner's event feed and sync changes feed no longer expose the reporter (A-M6)
- Migration 013 scrubs `actor_id`/`reason` from any historic `reported` rows
- `CreateReportDto.reason` is bounded to 2000 characters, rejecting oversized payloads with 400

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (TDD: test → feat):

1. **Task 1: email_verified-gated linking and race-free provisioning**
   - `9d36e1c` test(01.2-02): add failing coverage for email_verified-gated linking
   - `a7a995f` feat(01.2-02): gate account linking on email_verified, race-free provisioning
2. **Task 2: Private reports — redacted event, scrub migration, reason bound**
   - `147323f` test(01.2-02): add failing coverage for private reports and reason bound
   - `36011a3` feat(01.2-02): stop exposing reporter identity in the survey event feed

_TDD gate compliance: each task has a `test(...)` commit followed by a `feat(...)` commit; no `refactor(...)` commit was needed for either task._

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts` — `getOrProvisionUser` now branches on `email_verified`, uses `ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)` for inserts, and re-selects on `23505`
- `api/test/auth.guard.spec.ts` — 7 new unit cases covering the linking/race branches
- `api/test/auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts` — 3 new E2E cases (5-way concurrent race, unverified rejection, verified linking)
- `api/src/reports/reports.service.ts` — `survey_events` insert for `reported` drops `actor_id`/`reason`, keeps `{report_id}`
- `api/src/reports/reports.types.ts` — exports `REPORT_REASON_MAX_LENGTH = 2000`
- `api/src/reports/dtos/create-report.dto.ts` — `@MaxLength(REPORT_REASON_MAX_LENGTH)` on `reason`
- `api/migrations/013_scrub_reported_event_identity.sql` — scrubs `actor_id`/`reason` from existing `reported` events
- `api/test/epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` — added a global `ValidationPipe` to the test bootstrap; new assertions for owner-feed redaction, reports-table retention, reason length bound (400 at 2001 chars, 201 at 2000), and a migration-scrub check against a simulated legacy row
- `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md` — documents the reason length bound and event-feed redaction under `POST /reports`

## Decisions Made

- Kept email-based linking (per PROJECT.md D-08) but gated it strictly on `email_verified === true`; any other value (false, absent, non-boolean truthy) refuses linking and never writes `auth0_sub` — matches the plan's "strict boolean" requirement exactly.
- Used `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub) DO UPDATE SET auth0_sub = EXCLUDED.auth0_sub RETURNING ...` rather than a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock, per D-09 and the research's `Don't Hand-Roll` guidance — Postgres already guarantees this atomically since `auth0_sub` is UNIQUE (migration 011).
- `epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` had no `ValidationPipe` registered at all, so the new `@MaxLength` decorator would not have been exercised by that suite. Added the same `ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: false, transform: true })` config already used by `validation-reports.e2e-spec.ts`, scoped to this spec's own `TestingModule` bootstrap (no shared/global test config was touched).

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Added a ValidationPipe to epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts's test bootstrap**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (writing the reason-length E2E assertions)
- **Issue:** The plan's acceptance criteria requires `POST /v1/reports` with a 2001-char reason to return 400 via `@MaxLength`, but this spec file's `TestingModule` never registers `ValidationPipe`, so class-validator decorators are never evaluated — the request would pass through with a 201 regardless of the DTO's constraints.
- **Fix:** Added `app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: false, transform: true }))` in this file's `beforeAll`, mirroring the existing pattern in `validation-reports.e2e-spec.ts`.
- **Files modified:** api/test/epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts
- **Verification:** `npm --workspace api run test:e2e -- epic-e-search-reports` — 2001-char reason now returns 400, 2000-char reason returns 201.
- **Committed in:** 147323f (Task 2 test commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Necessary to make the plan's own acceptance criterion observable; no scope creep — only this spec file's local test bootstrap was touched, not the production app bootstrap (`app.setup.ts`) or shared test config.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the deviation above.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None — all new surface (the `email_verified` gate, `ON CONFLICT` provisioning, and the redacted `reported` event) was already covered by this plan's own `<threat_model>` (T-01.2-06 through T-01.2-09).

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- REQ-AUD-identity is fully closed: unverified emails cannot hijack accounts, first-login races converge on one row, and report privacy is enforced both going forward (service) and retroactively (migration 013).
- `api/migrations/013_scrub_reported_event_identity.sql` will run automatically via `npm run migrate` (already verified during E2E runs in this plan).
- No blockers for 01.2-03 (session error classification) or later 01.2-0x plans; this plan touched only `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts` and `api/src/reports/`, no mobile files.
