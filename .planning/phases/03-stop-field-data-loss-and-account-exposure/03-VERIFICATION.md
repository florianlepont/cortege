  - test: "Device re-check: revoke a refresh token in the Auth0 dashboard while online (expect session ends, queue kept, re-login with same account syncs it), and force an offline/expired-access-token state (expect session and queue kept)"

    why_human: "CR-01/WR-07/WR-08 rewired useLocalDataOwner, useAuth0Session and useSurveySyncNetwork state/effect logic after the original device pass (fb47368, 16:33 UTC) completed; the review-fix commits (55b1543...82ef8b2) landed later the same day (17:06-17:23 UTC), touching exactly the account-switch/session code the device test exercised. Automated tests cover the logic in isolation but not the real Auth0 SDK / real device timing the original checklist called for."
  - test: "Device re-check: log out with unsynced surveys/photos (expect count dialog, purge only on confirm), then log in with a different account on a device that still holds account A's unsynced data (expect blocking conflict screen with exactly two choices, no auto-sync)"
    expected: "Same behavior as the 2026-09-23 device confirmation (step 3-4), now including CR-01's per-sub `syncAllowed`, WR-01's queue-only fallback for visibility/attachment-delete/submit, and WR-08's suspend-drain-purge ordering"
    why_human: "These are exactly the paths CR-01, WR-01 and WR-08 modified after the original device pass; REVIEW-FIX.md marks all three 'requires human verification' in its own status field. renderHook regression tests exist and pass, but the review's own text (CR-01, WR-08) describes race conditions between renders/effects that unit tests approximate rather than prove on a real device/OS scheduler."
  - test: "Nearby-parcels list populated with real GPS + live parcel data on a device"
    expected: "List of nearby parcels renders correctly with corrected bbox order"
    why_human: "Needs real GPS and live parcel data; VALIDATION.md already carries this over to Phase 7 field tests. Not a regression concern (bbox order itself is unit-tested), listed here only for completeness of the human-verification set."
  - test: "Production rate limiting and trust-proxy value behind the real Caddy/Docker topology on the VPS"
    expected: "Unauthenticated requests are not all keyed on one Docker bridge IP; one syncing device cannot 429 every user"
    why_human: "Requires the real deployed topology; VALIDATION.md already carries this over as a post-deploy check. WR-05's fix and its unit test (`app-setup.spec.ts`) prove the Express trust-proxy function classifies the gateway/loopback/public-peer cases correctly, but only a live deploy proves `req.ip` behaves as expected end to end."

# Phase 01.2: Stop field data loss and account exposure Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Nothing an ecologist records offline can be destroyed by a session error, and no account or endpoint can be taken over or opened by configuration mistake.
**Verified:** 2026-09-23T18:00:00Z
**Status:** passed (human re-check of items 1–2 confirmed by the owner on 2026-09-24; items 3–4 carried over, see 03-HUMAN-UAT.md)
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification (includes post-review-fix code, per 03-REVIEW-FIX.md)

## Goal Achievement

### Quality Gate (run directly by this verifier, not taken from SUMMARY claims)

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `npm run lint` | PASS (0 errors, both workspaces) |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` | PASS (`tsc --noEmit` mobile, `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` api) |
| Unit tests | `npm run test:unit` | PASS — API 10 suites / 98 tests; mobile 39 suites / 497 tests |
| E2E tests | `npm run test:e2e` (real Postgres, env per task instructions) | PASS — 7 suites / 54 tests (`auth-profile`, `surveys-idempotency`, `auth-provisioning`, `epic-e-search-reports`, `validation-reports`, `rate-limit`, `debug-surface`) |

This matches (and independently reproduces) the numbers claimed in `03-REVIEW-FIX.md`'s "Quality gate after the last commit" section — verified by direct execution, not trusted from the document.

### Roadmap Success Criteria (7) — verified against code

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Network/timeout/unknown errors during token refresh never delete local data; only explicit refresh-token rejection ends the session, queue survives and syncs after re-login | ✓ VERIFIED | `mobile/src/hooks/auth-errors.ts` `classifyCredentialsError` — only `NO_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `RENEW_FAILED` while online, and `NO_CREDENTIALS` at restore return `"session-ended"`; everything else (including non-`CredentialsManagerError`) is `"retry-later"`. `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts:67-71` `clearSurveySessionState` (the `onSessionCleared` callback) resets only React state, never calls `clearLocalIbpData`. Unit tests: `auth-errors.test.ts`, `useAuth0Session.test.ts`, `useSurveySync.test.ts` all pass. |
| 2 | Logout with unsynced work shows a count and purges only after explicit confirmation; local data never attached to a different account after re-login | ✓ VERIFIED | `useSurveySync.ts:164-183` `handleLogout` calls `countUnsyncedLocalWork`/`hasUnsyncedWork`, shows `Alert.alert` with `formatUnsyncedWorkSummary`, purges only from the destructive button's `onPress`. D-04 owner marker (`local_meta.session_owner_sub`) in `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.ts`; `useLocalDataOwner.ts` computes `syncAllowed` tied to the approved `sub` (CR-01 fix) and `LocalDataOwnerConflictScreen.tsx` (140 lines) offers exactly two choices, no dismiss. |
| 3 | Trust proxy on loopback, per-user tracker when authenticated, raised production default | ✓ VERIFIED | `api/src/app.setup.ts` sets `trust proxy` to `loopback,uniquelocal` by default (WR-05 fix, with rationale comment); `api/src/auth/throttler.guard.ts` provides `clientTracker`/`ipTracker`; `api/src/common/rate-limit.config.ts` sets production defaults 600/min default, 3000/min IP ceiling, 60/min sync, 240/min upload, 10000/min outside production. `api/test/rate-limit.e2e-spec.ts` and `api/test/app-setup.spec.ts` pass. |
| 4 | `DebugModule`/HS256 path absent in production; `/v1/debug/*` → 404 | ✓ VERIFIED | `api/src/debug/debug-gating.ts` `isDebugSurfaceEnabled`; `api/src/app.module.ts:23` conditional import. `api/test/debug-surface.e2e-spec.ts` proves 404 for all three debug routes with `NODE_ENV=production` while `/v1/health` stays 200; `api/test/debug-surface.spec.ts` proves the HS256 branch rejects a token signed with `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` in production. |
| 5 | Email linking gated on `email_verified===true`; race-free provisioning; report no longer exposes reporter identity | ✓ VERIFIED | `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts` `getOrProvisionUser`: verified-only `UPDATE ... WHERE email=$2 AND auth0_sub IS NULL`, insert-first `ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)` then 23505 reclassification (WR-02/WR-03 fixes). `api/migrations/013_scrub_reported_event_identity.sql` strips `actor_id`/`reason` from existing `reported` events; `create-report.dto.ts` has `@MaxLength(REPORT_REASON_MAX_LENGTH)`. `api/test/auth-provisioning.e2e-spec.ts`, `auth.guard.spec.ts`, `epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` pass against a real Postgres instance. |
| 6 | Dev tools absent from production builds; nearby-parcels bbox `minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat` | ✓ VERIFIED | `mobile/src/app/dev-tools.ts` `shouldShowDevTools(__DEV__)`; wired in `SettingsScreen.tsx:220` and `App.tsx:34`. `mobile/src/app/map-viewport.ts` `buildBboxAroundPoint`/`computeRegionBbox` share `formatBbox(minLng,minLat,maxLng,maxLat)`; `useNearbyParcels.ts:74` calls `buildBboxAroundPoint`. `dev-tools.test.ts`, `map-viewport.test.ts`, `useNearbyParcels.test.ts` pass. |
| 7 | Pre-Auth0 stubs gone; no `accessToken \|\| refreshToken` check | ✓ VERIFIED | `grep -rn "handleVerifyEmail\|handleResendVerification\|handleCancelEmailVerification\|pendingEmailVerification\|devVerificationToken\|refreshToken: \"\"\|accessToken \|\| refreshToken" mobile/src` (excluding tests) returns no matches. |

**Score:** 7/7 roadmap success criteria verified.

### Plan Must-Haves — spot-checked at code level (not just SUMMARY claims)

All 9 plans' `must_haves.artifacts` and `key_links` were located and read directly:

- `api/src/common/rate-limit.config.ts`, `api/src/auth/throttler.guard.ts`, `api/src/app.setup.ts` — present, exported symbols match, wired into `main.ts`/`app.module.ts` (plan 01).
- `api/src/auth/auth.guard.ts` (`ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)`), `api/migrations/013_scrub_reported_event_identity.sql` (`event_type = 'reported'`), `create-report.dto.ts` (`MaxLength`) — present and match must-have `contains` patterns (plan 02).
- `mobile/src/hooks/auth-errors.ts`, `mobile/src/app/id-token.ts` — exports match; `useAuth0Session.ts` calls `classifyCredentialsError(` in both the restore effect and `getValidAccessToken` (plan 03).
- `mobile/src/app/map-viewport.ts`, `mobile/src/app/dev-tools.ts` — exports match; wired via `buildBboxAroundPoint(` in `useNearbyParcels.ts` and `shouldShowDevTools` in `SettingsScreen.tsx`/`App.tsx` (plan 04).
- `api/src/debug/debug-gating.ts` — exports `isDebugSurfaceEnabled`; conditional spread pattern found verbatim in `app.module.ts` (plan 05).
- `useSurveySync.ts` `clearSurveySessionState` contains no `clearLocalIbpData` call; `onSessionCleared: clearSurveySessionState` wiring confirmed (plan 06).
- `mobile/src/app/local-data-owner.ts`, `mobile/src/storage/local-owner.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useLocalDataOwner.ts` — all required exports present; `resolveLocalDataOwnership` decision wiring confirmed (plan 07).
- `LocalDataOwnerConflictScreen.tsx` is 140 lines (>40 min_lines); `useSurveySync.ts` contains `countUnsyncedLocalWork`; `useSurveySyncNetwork.ts` contains `syncAllowed` gating on every sync/pull path (plan 08).
- `03-VALIDATION.md` records per-task statuses and the Manual-Only Verifications table with an Outcome column (plan 09).

### Review-Fix Verification (CR-01, WR-01–WR-08) — verified directly, not trusted from REVIEW-FIX.md

| Finding | Fix location | Verified in code |
|---|---|---|
| CR-01 (stale `syncAllowed` across account switch) | `useLocalDataOwner.ts` `approvedSub`/`approvedSubRef`, `ensureSyncOwner` | `syncAllowed` requires `status === "ok" && approvedSub === sessionOwner?.sub`-equivalent gating (line 217); `ensureSyncOwner` re-reads `getLocalDataOwner()`. `assertSyncOwner` called in `useSurveySyncNetwork.ts` before every `syncPending`/`pullRemoteChanges` (lines 108, 192, 247) |
| WR-01 (visibility/attachment-delete bypass gate) | `useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts` | `assertSyncOwner` and `syncAllowed` checks present at lines 74, 168, 175, 265, 442 |
| WR-02 (concurrent unverified first login 401) | `auth.guard.ts` | SELECT-by-email pre-check removed; insert-first `ON CONFLICT (auth0_sub)` then 23505 reclassification confirmed by reading the function body |
| WR-03 (verified-email re-pointing) | `auth.guard.ts` | `UPDATE ... WHERE email=$2 AND auth0_sub IS NULL` confirmed |
| WR-04 (401 vs 403 on refusal) | `auth.guard.ts`, `auth-errors.ts` | `ForbiddenException({statusCode:403, code: EMAIL_ALREADY_LINKED_CODE, ...})` rethrown in `canActivate`'s catch guard (`if (err instanceof ForbiddenException) throw err`); `isEmailAlreadyLinkedError` checks status 403 + code |
| WR-05 (TRUST_PROXY default) | `app.setup.ts`, both `.env.example` files | Default changed to `"loopback,uniquelocal"`; `app-setup.spec.ts` passes (3/3 tests) |
| WR-06 (pending deletions not counted) | `local-owner.ts`, `local-data-owner.ts` | `countUnsyncedLocalWork` includes `deletionsRow` querying `sync_queue` rows with no matching `local_surveys` row; `hasUnsyncedWork` includes `work.deletions > 0` |
| WR-07 (permanent suspension on transient error) | `useLocalDataOwner.ts` | Exponential backoff retry (`OWNER_CHECK_RETRY_BASE_MS`/`_MAX_MS`) confirmed present with reset-on-decision logic |
| WR-08 (in-flight sync writes after purge) | `sync-activity.ts` (new), `useSurveySync.ts` | `createSyncActivity`/`purgeWhileSyncSuspended` implemented; `performLogoutAndPurge` suspends sync, awaits `waitForIdle()`, then purges |

All 9 findings are fixed in the code, not merely claimed. Quality gate (including new regression tests named in REVIEW-FIX.md: `sync-owner-gate.test.ts`, `useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts`, `sync-activity.test.ts`, `local-owner.sqlite.test.ts`, `auth-provisioning.e2e-spec.ts`, `app-setup.spec.ts`) is green, confirmed by direct execution above.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan(s) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-AUD-session-data-loss | 03, 06, 07, 08 (09 gate) | ✓ SATISFIED | SC 1, 2, 7 above; CR-01/WR-01/WR-07/WR-08 fixes |
| REQ-AUD-rate-limit | 01 (09 gate) | ✓ SATISFIED | SC 3 above; WR-05 fix |
| REQ-AUD-debug-surface | 05 (09 gate) | ✓ SATISFIED | SC 4 above |
| REQ-AUD-identity | 02 (09 gate) | ✓ SATISFIED | SC 5 above; WR-02/WR-03/WR-04 fixes |
| REQ-AUD-mobile-quick-fixes | 04 (09 gate) | ✓ SATISFIED | SC 6 above |

No orphaned requirements: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` maps exactly these five IDs to Phase 1.2, and all five appear in at least one plan's `requirements` frontmatter and in `03-09-SUMMARY.md`'s `requirements-completed`. `03-07-SUMMARY.md` intentionally lists `requirements-completed: []` with a documented deviation note ("plan 08 wires this into the app and closes it") — plan 08's summary does close REQ-AUD-session-data-loss, so this is not a gap.

### Anti-Patterns Found

No debt markers (`TBD`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, `TODO`, `HACK`) found in any file touched by this phase's plans. The only `placeholder` matches in the touched file set are React Native `TextInput` `placeholder`/`placeholderTextColor` props (`PublicMapScreen.tsx`, `SurveyListScreen.tsx`) — legitimate UI text, not stub markers.

### Data-Flow / Wiring Notes

- `onSessionCleared` → `clearSurveySessionState` is wired at `useAuth0Session({..., onSessionCleared: clearSurveySessionState})` and never touches SQLite (verified above) — this is the load-bearing wiring for SC 1 and was the site of the original M-C1 defect.
- `syncAllowed` → gates every drain path (`runSync`, `maybeAutoSync`, `handlePullChanges`, visibility toggle, attachment delete, survey submit) — confirmed by grep across all four hook files; no path calls `syncPending`/`pullRemoteChanges` without a `syncAllowed`/`assertSyncOwner` guard.
- Migration 013 targets `event_type = 'reported'` exactly, matching the survey-events redaction requirement; the `reports` table (not touched) retains reporter identity for moderation, per D-10.

## Human Verification Required (why status is `human_needed`, not `passed`)

The developer's device pass (`03-VALIDATION.md`, confirmed 2026-09-23, commit `fb47368` at 16:33 UTC) covered steps 1-5 of the Manual-Only Verifications table. However, the 9 review-fix commits (`55b1543` through `82ef8b2`, 17:06-17:23 UTC — **after** the device pass) rewrote exactly the state/concurrency logic that steps 1-4 exercise: `useLocalDataOwner.ts`, `useAuth0Session.ts`, `useSurveySyncNetwork.ts`, `useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts`, and `useSurveySync.ts`. `03-REVIEW-FIX.md` itself marks CR-01, WR-01, WR-02, WR-07 and WR-08 as **"fixed: requires human verification"** in their own status lines — this is not a new demand invented by this verifier, it is the fixer's own documented residual risk, and it has not yet been discharged on a device.

Per the task instructions and this analysis, the following are listed as items needing human verification (see YAML frontmatter `human_verification` for full detail):

1. Re-check offline/expired-token session-keeping and revoked-refresh-token session-ending on a real device (steps 1-2 equivalent, now through the CR-01/WR-07/WR-08 code paths).
2. Re-check logout-with-unsynced-work dialog and the other-account conflict screen on a real device (steps 3-4 equivalent, now through the CR-01/WR-01/WR-08 code paths).
3. Nearby-parcels list on real GPS/live data — already an acknowledged carry-over to Phase 7, listed for completeness.
4. Production rate limiting / trust-proxy value behind the real Caddy/Docker topology — already an acknowledged carry-over to post-deploy, listed for completeness.

Items 3 and 4 were already explicitly carried over by the developer in `03-VALIDATION.md` and are not new gaps — they are restated here only because the task instructions require every human-verification item to be listed. Items 1 and 2 are the genuinely new residual risk introduced by the timing gap between the device pass and the review fixes.

## Gaps Summary

No code-level gaps found. Every roadmap success criterion, every plan must-have, and every review-fix finding is implemented and covered by a passing automated test, and the full quality gate (lint, typecheck, 98+497 unit tests, 54 E2E tests) is green when run directly by this verifier. The only reason this phase is not marked `passed` is that a device re-check of the account-switch/logout/conflict paths, which changed after the last device pass, has not yet been recorded. This is a process/timing gap, not an implementation gap — recommend a short device re-check of steps 1-4 (or at minimum 2-4, the paths CR-01/WR-01/WR-08 actually touch) before treating Phase 1.2 as fully closed, then updating `03-VALIDATION.md`'s Outcome column accordingly.
