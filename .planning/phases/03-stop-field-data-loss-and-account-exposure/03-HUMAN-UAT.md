## Current Test

Complete — tests 1–2 confirmed on device by the owner (2026-09-24); tests 3–4 carried over (Phase 7 field tests, post-deploy check).

## Tests

### 1. Device re-check — session keep and revoked refresh token (after review fixes)
expected: Offline / expired access token keeps the session and all local data; revoking the refresh token in the Auth0 dashboard while online ends the session, keeps the queue, and re-login with the same account syncs it
result: pass (owner device re-check, 2026-09-24)

### 2. Device re-check — logout with unsynced work and other-account conflict (after review fixes)
expected: Logout shows the count and purges only on confirm; logging in with account B while A's unsynced data is on the device shows the blocking conflict screen with exactly two choices and sends nothing under B
result: pass (owner device re-check, 2026-09-24)

### 3. Nearby-parcels list on real GPS and live parcel data
expected: The nearby-parcels list is populated (carry-over to Phase 7 field tests)
result: skipped — carried over to Phase 7 field tests

### 4. Production rate limiting and trust proxy behind Caddy/Docker on the VPS
expected: Unauthenticated requests are not all keyed on one Docker bridge IP; no 429 bursts under concurrent sync (carry-over to post-deploy)
result: skipped — carried over to post-deploy check
