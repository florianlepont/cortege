# Phase 01.3: CI and test safety net - Research

**Researched:** 2026-09-24
**Domain:** GitHub Actions CI/CD (npm workspaces monorepo), Docker image reproducibility, Jest test infrastructure (NestJS + Expo/React Native)
**Confidence:** HIGH — this phase's target state is already largely specified by the project's own audit (`docs/audits/audit-2026-09-code-complet.md` §6) and remediation plan (`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md`, lots L5–L7). Research here is mostly measurement (running the actual commands) rather than discovery.

## Summary

Phase 01.3 turns three already-diagnosed gaps into a working CI pipeline: (1) `npm run typecheck` is never run in CI even though it passes today in ~8s; (2) `api/Dockerfile` builds from a lockfile-less `api/` directory, ignores root `overrides`, runs as root, and can be pushed from any branch as `:latest`; (3) mobile tests mock SQLite with pure spies so broken SQL passes, hook tests spy on `React.useState` instead of using `renderHook`, `.test.tsx` files are silently never collected, and the E2E database is never reset between runs. All three are corroborated by fresh local measurements in this research session, not just the audit's claims from commit `a499358`.

The audit already sketched a target workflow (`audit-2026-09-code-complet.md` §6, "Esquisse de workflow cible") and the remediation plan gives near-executable detail for L5 (CI restructuring), L6 (Docker), and L7 (test infra). This research verifies every claim in that sketch against the current repo state (which has moved since the audit — phase 1.2 already added `@testing-library/react-native`, `test-renderer`, and a `node:sqlite`-backed test double) and fills in the concrete numbers the planner needs: today's typecheck/audit/coverage results, the actual `npm ci --workspace api` behavior for image size, resolved action SHAs, and `expo-doctor`'s current two failures.

**Primary recommendation:** Implement the audit's target workflow structure (`changes` → `check` → `unit` matrix → `e2e` → `mobile-build` → `ci-ok` → `build`) almost verbatim, since it has already been designed for this exact repo. Fix the two `expo-doctor` failures as one task before wiring the `mobile-build` job, since it would otherwise be red from day one. Rewrite `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` to route `expo-sqlite` through the already-existing `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` (built in phase 1.2, currently used only in one file) instead of the current jest.fn() stub, rather than introducing `better-sqlite3` as a new dependency — `node:sqlite` is a Node 22 built-in already proven to work in this repo and needs no new package.

## Architectural Responsibility Map

| Capability | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Typecheck / lint / format gating | CI (GitHub Actions) | — | Pure build-time verification, no runtime tier owns it |
| Path-based job skipping | CI (GitHub Actions) | — | `dorny/paths-filter` output gates downstream jobs |
| Docker image build & push | CI (GitHub Actions) → CDN/Registry (GHCR) | — | CI builds and pushes; GHCR is the artifact store the VPS timer polls |
| Image runtime user / healthcheck | Container runtime (Docker) | API / Backend | Dockerfile controls `USER`/`HEALTHCHECK`; `/v1/health` is served by the NestJS app |
| Mobile SQL storage tests | Test infra (Node process, `node:sqlite`) | Mobile / Client (SQLite schema under test) | Tests run in Node via Jest, exercising the same SQL the Expo SQLite runtime executes on-device |
| Mobile hook tests (`renderHook`) | Test infra (Node process, RNTL) | Mobile / Client (hooks under test) | RNTL renders hooks in a simulated RN environment inside Jest |
| E2E API tests | Test infra (Jest + Supertest) | API / Backend, Database | Exercises the real NestJS app against a real PostgreSQL instance provisioned by the CI job |
| Coverage thresholds | CI (GitHub Actions) | Test infra (Jest `coverageThreshold`) | Jest computes and enforces; CI job fails the build |
| Dependency/vulnerability scanning | CI (GitHub Actions) | — | `npm audit`, CodeQL — supply-chain concern, not a runtime tier |
| Branch protection / required check | GitHub platform (repo settings) | CI (GitHub Actions) | `ci-ok` is produced by CI; the *requirement* that it pass is a GitHub setting the owner must configure, not code |

## Standard Stack

### Core

| Tool | Version (verified) | Purpose | Why Standard |
|------|---------------------|---------|---------------|
| `actions/checkout` | `v4.4.0` = `11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262` [VERIFIED: `git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/actions/checkout`, resolved live this session] | Checks out the repo | Already in use; keep on `v4` line (not `v7`, a bigger jump than this phase should absorb) |
| `actions/setup-node` | `v4.4.0` = `49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020` [VERIFIED: same method] | Installs Node, wires npm cache | Already in use |
| `actions/cache` | `v4.3.0` = `0057852bfaa89a56745cba8c7296529d2fc39830` [VERIFIED: same method] | Caches `node_modules` keyed on lockfile hash (audit CI-6) | Standard GH cache action; not currently used — new addition |
| `dorny/paths-filter` | `v3.0.4` = `0e4a8c6effa4802afeda77dc8d303f8176d7dfad` [VERIFIED: same method] | Path-based job skipping, third-party so SHA-pinning matters most here | Already in use, currently pinned by tag only |
| `docker/setup-buildx-action` | `v3.12.0` = `8d2750c68a42422c14e847fe6c8ac0403b4cbd6f` [VERIFIED] | Docker Buildx setup | Already in use |
| `docker/login-action` | `v3.7.0` = `c94ce9fb468520275223c153574b00df6fe4bcc9` [VERIFIED] | GHCR login | Already in use |
| `docker/build-push-action` | `v6.19.2` = `10e90e3645eae34f1e60eeb005ba3a3d33f178e8` [VERIFIED] | Build & push the API image | Already in use |
| `github/codeql-action` | `v3.38.1` = `e429ea58a9912cadc53f8132ad35562b54de1b30` [VERIFIED] | CodeQL init/analyze for JS/TS | New addition for criterion 6 |

All eight SHAs above were resolved live via `git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` against the official upstream repositories during this research session (2026-09-24) — this is an authoritative, verifiable source, not training-data recall. **Re-resolve at execution time** if more than a few days pass before the plan runs, since patch releases land frequently (`git ls-remote --tags <url> | grep -E '^refs/tags/v4\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' | sort -V | tail -1`, then read the SHA from the matching line). The plan should encode this exact command so the executing agent re-verifies rather than trusting a stale value baked into the plan.

### Supporting

| Tool | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) | Node 22 built-in [VERIFIED: `node -e "require('node:sqlite')"` succeeds on the Node 22.22.2 used by `npm --version` in this sandbox and by CI's `node-version: 22`] | Backs `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` (already written in phase 1.2) with a real in-memory SQL engine | Storage tests that need real SQL execution instead of spies |
| `@testing-library/react-native` | `^14.0.1` [VERIFIED: `mobile/package.json`, already installed by phase 1.2] | `renderHook` for hook tests | Any new/rewritten hook test |
| `test-renderer` | `^1.3.0` [VERIFIED: `mobile/package.json`, already installed] | RNTL 14's internal renderer under React 19 | Installed automatically as RNTL's dependency; no action needed |
| `expo-doctor` | latest via `npx` (resolved `1.20.4` this session) [VERIFIED: ran successfully] | Validates `app.json`/Metro config against the installed Expo SDK | `mobile-build` CI job |
| `expo export --platform android` | Expo 57 CLI (already a project dependency) | Produces a real Metro bundle, catching prebuild/bundler breakage tests can't see | `mobile-build` CI job |

### Alternatives Considered

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `node:sqlite` for real-SQL storage tests | `better-sqlite3` (native npm package) | The remediation plan (`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md` L7) names `better-sqlite3`, written before phase 1.2 shipped `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` on `node:sqlite`. `node:sqlite` needs **no new dependency**, no native build step in CI, and is already proven working in this repo (`mobile/src/storage/local-owner.sqlite.test.ts`). Recommend **staying on `node:sqlite`**, not introducing `better-sqlite3` — the plan's letter changed since the audit was written, but its intent (real SQL execution) is already satisfied by an existing, lighter mechanism. `node:sqlite` is still flagged experimental (`ExperimentalWarning: SQLite is an experimental feature`) as of Node 22.22 — acceptable for a test-only dependency, not for production code, which does not use it. |
| Multi-job `unit` matrix `[api, mobile]` | Two separate named jobs (current state) | A matrix is what the audit sketch proposes and slightly reduces workflow YAML duplication; either is fine functionally. Recommend the matrix since it also makes the per-workspace `if: needs.changes.outputs.X == 'true'` skip logic one line instead of two. |
| GHCR image size reduction via multi-stage `npm ci --workspace api` | `npm ci --workspace api --include-workspace-root` (current de-facto behavior once building from root) | Verified locally (see Package Legitimacy Audit / build simulation below): explicitly setting `--include-workspace-root=true` pulls the **entire root `dependencies` block** (`expo`, `react`, `react-native` — none of which the API needs) into the image, ballooning `node_modules` from 133 MB to 529 MB. Plain `npm ci --workspace api` (no `--include-workspace-root` flag) defaults to **not** including the root project's own dependencies and stays at 215 MB (dev) / 133 MB (`--omit=dev`, production stage). **This is the load-bearing detail for L6**: the Dockerfile must NOT pass `--include-workspace-root`. |

**Installation:** No new npm packages are required for this phase. Every tool above is either already an `npm` dependency (RNTL, test-renderer), a Node built-in (`node:sqlite`), or invoked via `npx`/GitHub Actions (no `npm install` needed in the repo).

**Version verification:** `npm run typecheck` ran clean in this session (see Metadata). `npx expo-doctor` self-installed `expo-doctor@1.20.4` via `npx` without modifying `mobile/package.json` (confirmed by `git status --porcelain` showing no diff afterward).

## Package Legitimacy Audit

No new external packages are introduced by this phase's recommended approach — `node:sqlite` is a Node runtime built-in, and every CI tool is either an already-installed npm devDependency or a GitHub Action referenced by SHA. The Package Legitimacy Gate is **not applicable**; nothing to run `slopcheck` against.

| Package | Registry | Age | Downloads | Source Repo | slopcheck | Disposition |
|---------|----------|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| *(none — no new packages)* | — | — | — | — | — | N/A |

**Packages removed due to slopcheck [SLOP] verdict:** none
**Packages flagged as suspicious [SUS]:** none

If a later plan decides to introduce `better-sqlite3` anyway (e.g., if `node:sqlite`'s experimental status becomes a blocker), it must go through the full Package Legitimacy Gate at that time — it was not audited here because this research recommends against introducing it.

  workflow (separate .yml)         github-actions ecosystem to be added)
```

A reader can trace the primary path: a PR triggers `changes`, which fans out to `check`/`unit`/`e2e`/`mobile-build`/`audit` gated by what changed, all of which `ci-ok` aggregates into the one required status check; only a push to `main` that passed `ci-ok` proceeds to `build`, which is the only job that talks to GHCR; the VPS's own out-of-band timer is the only thing that ever deploys, polling the registry rather than being pushed to.

```

### Pattern 1: `changes` job with output flags consumed by `if:` conditions

**What:** A single job computes boolean outputs per path group; every downstream job gates on `needs.changes.outputs.<name> == 'true'`.
**When to use:** Any monorepo CI where unrelated workspaces shouldn't pay for each other's test/build cost.
**Example (adapted from the existing `changes` job, extended per L5):**
```yaml
# Source: docs/audits/audit-2026-09-code-complet.md §6 ("Esquisse de workflow cible"),
# adapted from the existing .github/workflows/ci.yml `changes` job (currently PR-skipped)
changes:
  name: Detect changed paths
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 5
  outputs:
    api: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.api }}
    mobile: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.mobile }}
    shared: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.shared }}
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262 # v4.4.0
    - uses: dorny/paths-filter@0e4a8c6effa4802afeda77dc8d303f8176d7dfad # v3.0.4
      id: filter
      with:
        filters: |
          api:
            - 'api/**'
          mobile:
            - 'mobile/**'
          shared:
            - 'package.json'
            - 'package-lock.json'
            - '.github/workflows/**'
            - '.eslintrc.json'
            - '.prettierrc.json'
            - 'tsconfig*.json'
```
**Critical fix vs. current state:** the existing `changes` job has `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`, which the audit calls out (CI-3) as the reason PRs never get path filtering — this condition must be **removed** so `changes` runs on every PR too.

### Pattern 2: `ci-ok` aggregator as the sole required check

**What:** A job with `if: always()` that inspects `needs.*.result` for every upstream job and fails if any required one failed — including ones that were legitimately skipped by path filters (treat `skipped` as passing).
**When to use:** Any workflow with conditional/skippable jobs, so branch protection can require one stable check name regardless of which jobs actually ran.
**Example:**
```yaml
# Source: pattern is a standard GitHub Actions idiom for skippable-job aggregation;
# adapted to this repo's job names from docs/audits/audit-2026-09-code-complet.md §6
ci-ok:
  name: CI OK
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 5
  if: always()
  needs: [check, unit, e2e, mobile-build, audit]
  steps:
    - name: Check all required jobs succeeded or were skipped
      run: |
        for r in "${{ needs.check.result }}" "${{ needs.unit.result }}" "${{ needs.e2e.result }}" "${{ needs.mobile-build.result }}" "${{ needs.audit.result }}"; do
          if [ "$r" != "success" ] && [ "$r" != "skipped" ]; then
            echo "A required job did not succeed: $r"
            exit 1
          fi
        done
```

### Pattern 3: Docker build from monorepo root without pulling in unrelated workspaces

**What:** Build context is `.` (repo root), not `./api`; the Dockerfile copies the root lockfile plus only `api/package.json`, then runs `npm ci --workspace api` (no `--include-workspace-root` flag) so the root's own `dependencies` (`expo`, `react`, `react-native` — needed only by `mobile`) are never installed.
**When to use:** Any Docker build in an npm-workspaces monorepo where the root `package.json` happens to carry dependencies unrelated to the service being containerized.
**Verified locally this session** (see Package Legitimacy Audit note above): `npm ci --workspace api --omit=dev` with no `--include-workspace-root` flag produces a 133 MB `node_modules` with zero `expo`/`react`/`react-native` packages present; the same command with `--include-workspace-root=true` produces 529 MB and pulls in the entire Expo tree.
```dockerfile
# Source: verified locally 2026-09-24 (npm 10.9.7, Node 22.22.2) against this repo's
# actual package.json / package-lock.json / api/package.json
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
COPY api/package.json ./api/
RUN npm ci --workspace api
COPY api ./api
RUN npm --workspace api run build

FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
COPY api/package.json ./api/
RUN npm ci --workspace api --omit=dev
COPY --from=builder /app/api/dist ./api/dist
COPY api/scripts ./api/scripts
COPY api/migrations ./api/migrations
RUN addgroup -S nodegrp && adduser -S nodeusr -G nodegrp \
    && chown -R nodeusr:nodegrp /app
USER nodeusr
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=20s --retries=3 \
  CMD node -e "require('http').get('http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/health', r => process.exit(r.statusCode===200?0:1)).on('error', ()=>process.exit(1))"
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["sh", "-c", "node api/scripts/migrate.js && node api/dist/main.js"]
```
Note the Alpine base has no `curl`; the healthcheck above uses Node itself (already present) instead of adding `curl`/`wget` to the image, keeping the attack surface unchanged. `USER node` (the existing `node:*` image's built-in non-root user, uid 1000) is simpler than creating `nodeusr` and is the more common convention — recommend `USER node` unless a reason emerges to avoid the built-in account; both accomplish "runs as a non-root user."

### Pattern 4: `node:sqlite`-backed `expo-sqlite` mock (real SQL, still test-doubled)

**What:** Replace the `mobile/test/expo-sqlite.mock.ts` module (currently pure `jest.fn()` stubs returning `undefined`/`[]`/`null`) with one that delegates to the already-written `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` helper, so every call to `openDatabaseAsync` in a test returns a real in-memory database that executes real SQL.
**When to use:** `mobile/jest.unit.config.js`'s global `moduleNameMapper` for `^expo-sqlite$` — this makes real SQL the *default* for every existing storage test, not an opt-in per file.
**Current state (verified this session):**
```typescript
// Source: mobile/test/expo-sqlite.mock.ts (current, pre-phase-01.3)
const mockDb = {
  execAsync: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  runAsync: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  getAllAsync: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
  getFirstAsync: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(null),
  closeAsync: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
}
export const openDatabaseAsync = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockDb)
```
```typescript
// Source: mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts (already exists, written in phase 1.2,
// used today only by mobile/src/storage/local-owner.sqlite.test.ts)
import { DatabaseSync, SQLInputValue } from "node:sqlite"
export function createNodeSqliteDb() {
  const db = new DatabaseSync(":memory:")
  // ...execAsync/runAsync/getFirstAsync/getAllAsync/withTransactionAsync/closeAsync
  // implemented against the real DatabaseSync instance
}
```
**Recommended change:** make `expo-sqlite.mock.ts` itself call `createNodeSqliteDb()` (one instance per test file, matching how `openDatabaseAsync` is called once per module load in the real `storage.ts`), rather than requiring every future test file to import `node-sqlite-db.ts` by hand. `storage.test.ts` (the file the audit specifically calls out as asserting on SQL string fragments against pure spies) must then be rewritten to assert on table state (`SELECT` after the operation under test) instead of `mockDb.runAsync.mock.calls`.
**Node version dependency:** `DatabaseSync` requires **Node ≥ 22.5** (stabilized further in 22.x; still marked experimental — confirmed by the `ExperimentalWarning` printed on every use in this session). CI already pins `node-version: 22` via `actions/setup-node`, which resolves to the latest Node 22.x at runtane — verify this stays ≥ 22.5 (it does today: this sandbox's Node is 22.22.2). No `engines` field exists in any `package.json` in this repo to enforce a floor — recommend adding `"engines": { "node": ">=22.5.0" }` to root `package.json` as part of this phase so a future contributor on an older Node doesn't get a confusing `node:sqlite` import failure.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Introducing `better-sqlite3` as specified literally in the remediation plan:** the plan predates phase 1.2's `node:sqlite`-based solution. Adding a second SQL-in-tests mechanism would be redundant and would need native module compilation in CI (slower, more fragile) for no behavioral gain.
- **Rewriting `useSurveySync.test.ts` wholesale in this phase:** it is 751 lines of spy-based tests (`jest.spyOn(React, "useState"/"useCallback"/"useEffect")`) and is explicitly *not* required to be perfect by REQ-AUD-test-infra's wording ("hooks are tested with `renderHook`" — satisfied by five files that already do this; a full rewrite of the biggest legacy file is higher-risk than this phase's stated scope). Recommend: leave it as-is or do a scoped rewrite only if time allows; do not block phase completion on it. Flag as an Open Question below.
- **Setting `cancel-in-progress: true` on the `main`-branch `build`/deploy job:** the audit explicitly calls for `cancel-in-progress: false` on the deploy concurrency group — cancelling an in-flight image push could leave a half-pushed manifest.
- **Trusting a training-data-recalled action SHA:** every SHA in this document was resolved live via `git ls-remote` this session; a plan or executor must not copy a SHA "remembered" from elsewhere without re-resolving it (upstream tags get re-cut for patch releases regularly).

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| Aggregating conditional/skipped CI job results into one required check | A custom GitHub App or webhook | The `ci-ok` shell-loop pattern (Pattern 2 above) | Standard, zero-dependency, works with GitHub's "required status checks" exactly as documented |
| Real SQL execution in storage tests | A hand-rolled SQL parser/fake, or shelling out to a real Postgres for unit tests | `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) via the existing `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` | Already built in this repo (phase 1.2); genuinely executes the SQL under test; no native compile step |
| E2E database isolation | Hand-rolled row-counting/prefix conventions to avoid cross-test pollution (current `Date.now()` approach) | `TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE` in a Jest `globalSetup`, per the remediation plan | Deterministic, matches Postgres's own primitive for exactly this purpose |
| Coverage ratcheting | A custom script diffing coverage JSON across commits | Jest's built-in `coverageThreshold` (global + per-`collectCoverageFrom`-glob) | Built into the tool already in use; fails the Jest process itself, no extra CI step needed |
| Vulnerability gating | Parsing `npm audit --json` by hand | `npm audit --audit-level=high` exit code (non-zero when a `high`/`critical` finding exists) | Built into npm; verified this session to correctly exit 0 today (only moderate findings exist) |

**Key insight:** every piece of infrastructure this phase needs (`ci-ok` aggregation, real-SQL testing, DB reset, coverage gating, audit gating) has a built-in or already-present mechanism in this exact repo. The work is wiring, not building.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: `mobile-build` job (`expo-doctor`/`expo export`) starts red
**What goes wrong:** Turning on `npx expo-doctor` in CI immediately fails the build, because it fails **today**, locally, with 2 findings: `app.json` has an undocumented `newArchEnabled` key, and `metro.config.js`'s `resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup: true` differs from Expo's recommended default (`false`).
**Why it happens:** these were never checked before (audit CI-5: "Pas de contrôle du build mobile"), so nobody was forced to reconcile them.
**How to avoid:** fix both before wiring the CI job, or accept `expo-doctor`'s specific two findings with a documented reason and use `npx expo-doctor --exit-code 0` style suppression *only* if there's a real justification (the metro override has an inline comment explaining why it exists — `disableHierarchicalLookup` pins module resolution to the mobile workspace in this monorepo, which may be a legitimate reason to keep it and instead pin `expo-doctor`'s specific check off, but there is no such flag for `expo-doctor` — it doesn't support ignoring an individual check, only running with lower strictness). See Open Questions.
**Warning signs:** `mobile-build` red on the very first PR that touches nothing mobile-related, because it isn't the diff that's wrong — the pre-existing config is.

### Pitfall 2: `npm ci --workspace api` silently installing the wrong tree if `--include-workspace-root` is added "for consistency"
**What goes wrong:** A future contributor "fixing" the Dockerfile by adding `--include-workspace-root=true` (a plausible-looking flag if someone reads npm's docs about workspace root inclusion) reintroduces the entire Expo/React Native dependency tree into the API image (529 MB vs. 133 MB, confirmed this session).
**Why it happens:** npm's own documentation on `--include-workspace-root` is easy to misread as "needed to make workspace deps resolve," when in this repo's case the *default* (omitting the flag) is what avoids the bloat, because root `package.json`'s own `dependencies` block (`expo`, `react`, `react-native`) exists only for `mobile`'s benefit, not shared tooling.
**How to avoid:** a code comment directly above the `RUN npm ci --workspace api` line in the Dockerfile explaining this, plus (ideally, longer-term, out of this phase's scope) moving `expo`/`react`/`react-native` out of the root `package.json` and into `mobile/package.json` where they conceptually belong — flagged as an Open Question, not blocking this phase.
**Warning signs:** image size regressions visible in `docker images` after a Dockerfile change; `npm ls expo` inside the built image returning a result when it shouldn't.

### Pitfall 3: `changes` job losing its current behavior when made PR-aware
**What goes wrong:** The existing `changes` job is gated `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`, explicitly to keep it out of the PR flow (per its own docstring intent, even though the audit calls this a bug). Removing that condition without also removing the workflow's separate always-on unconditional test jobs (`test-unit-api`, `test-unit-mobile`, `test-e2e-api` in the *current* `ci.yml`) means both the old unconditional jobs and the new conditional ones could run side by side if the rewrite is partial.
**Why it happens:** L5 describes a wholesale workflow restructuring, not an incremental patch — a plan that tries to "add path filtering" onto the existing job names without replacing them risks a doubled, confusing workflow.
**How to avoid:** treat `ci.yml`'s rewrite as one atomic replacement (single file, single task/plan) rather than incremental job-by-job edits across multiple plans, given the single-file-overlap constraint below.
**Warning signs:** CI run showing both `test-unit-api` and a new `unit (api)` matrix entry, or two Docker builds firing per push.

### Pitfall 4: E2E `globalSetup` DB reset racing NestJS's own migration runner
**What goes wrong:** `api/scripts/migrate.js` already runs in the `test-e2e-api` CI job? — **verified NOT currently true**: `npm run test:e2e` (`api/package.json`'s script, not directly inspected here but inferred from `ci.yml`'s `run: npm run test:e2e` with no preceding `npm run migrate:api` in the E2E job) relies on migrations having already been applied to the CI Postgres service by a prior step, or the app applying them at boot. Introducing a `globalSetup` that does `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE` must run **after** migrations have created the tables, not race them.
**Why it happens:** Jest's `globalSetup` runs once before any test file, in a separate process from `beforeAll` hooks — if migrations aren't guaranteed to have already run by that point, `TRUNCATE` on a nonexistent table throws.
**How to avoid:** confirm (during planning/execution, by reading `api/package.json`'s exact `test:e2e` script and the CI job) whether migrations run before Jest starts, and make `globalSetup` either call `migrate.js` itself first or assert the CI job order already guarantees it.
**Warning signs:** `relation "surveys" does not exist` errors only in CI, not locally (where a developer's local Postgres already has the schema from previous work).

## Code Examples

### `check` job — single `npm ci`, then lint + format + typecheck
```yaml
# Source: docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md L5 ("Job `check`"), combined with
# the existing `quality` job's steps in .github/workflows/ci.yml
check:
  name: Lint, format, typecheck
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 10
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262 # v4.4.0
    - uses: actions/setup-node@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020 # v4.4.0
      with:
        node-version: 22
        cache: npm
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run lint
    - run: npm run format:check
    - run: npm run typecheck
```

### `audit` job
```yaml
# Source: docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md L5; verified this session that
# `npm audit --audit-level=high` currently exits 0 (only moderate findings exist)
audit:
  name: Dependency audit
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 10
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262 # v4.4.0
    - uses: actions/setup-node@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020 # v4.4.0
      with:
        node-version: 22
        cache: npm
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm audit --audit-level=high
```

### Coverage thresholds (ratchet), api and mobile Jest configs
```js
// Source: measured this session — see Metadata for the exact commands and output.
// api/jest.unit.config.js addition (statement/branch/function/line % rounded DOWN
// from today's measured unit-only numbers so the ratchet doesn't start red):
module.exports = {
  // ...existing config...
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      statements: 45,
      branches: 24,
      functions: 32,
      lines: 45,
    },
  },
}
```
```js
// mobile/jest.unit.config.js addition (measured this session, unit-only):
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 51,
    branches: 30,
    functions: 41,
    lines: 52,
  },
},
```
**Per-directory thresholds** (criterion 5 explicitly asks for per-directory, not just global) should use Jest's glob-keyed `coverageThreshold` entries, e.g. `"./src/hooks/**/*.ts": { ... }`, `"./src/screens/**/*.tsx": { ... }` — set each to today's measured value per the per-file table already printed by `--coverage` (captured in full in this session's tool output; the planner should re-run `npm run test:coverage:api`/`test:coverage:mobile` at execution time to get exact current numbers, since these will shift slightly as phase 01.3's own test-infra changes land first).

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `mobile/test/expo-sqlite.mock.ts` pure spies | `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` (`node:sqlite`-backed) | Introduced in phase 1.2 (2026-09-24, this milestone) but **not yet wired as the default mock** — only one test file uses it | This phase should make it the default via `moduleNameMapper`, not just leave it as an opt-in helper |
| Hook tests spying on `React.useState`/`useCallback`/`useEffect` | `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-native` | RNTL 14 + `renderHook` already adopted for 5 of the newer hook test files in phase 1.2 | `useSurveySync.test.ts` (751 lines) is the one major holdout — see Open Questions |
| `actions/checkout@v4` (tag) | Same major is still current and actively patched (`v4.4.0` as of this session); `v7` exists upstream but is a bigger leap | N/A — recommend staying on `v4`, just pinning by SHA | No functional change, just supply-chain hardening |

**Deprecated/outdated:**
- The remediation plan's literal suggestion of `better-sqlite3` for L7 is superseded by phase 1.2's `node:sqlite` solution, which already exists in the repo and needs no new dependency.

## Assumptions Log

| # | Claim | Section | Risk if Wrong |
|---|-------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | `USER node` (built-in image account) is an acceptable interpretation of "runs as a non-root user" vs. a custom-created user | Architecture Patterns / Pattern 3 | Low — both satisfy the literal success criterion; a reviewer preference either way is cheap to change |
| A2 | The `test:e2e` CI job order (migrate-then-test vs. app-migrates-at-boot) needs confirmation by reading `api/package.json`'s exact script content at plan time, not assumed from this research | Common Pitfalls / Pitfall 4 | Medium — a `globalSetup` `TRUNCATE` could crash CI if it runs before schema creation; must be verified during planning, not assumed |
| A3 | Node 22.x in GitHub Actions' `actions/setup-node@node-version: 22` will resolve to ≥ 22.5 (required for `node:sqlite`) indefinitely | Architecture Patterns / Pattern 4 | Low — GitHub Actions' Node 22 is actively maintained and always resolves to a recent patch; pinning `engines` mitigates local-dev drift, not CI drift |

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

1. **Should `useSurveySync.test.ts` be rewritten to `renderHook` in this phase, or deferred?** — **RESOLVED:** not rewritten in this phase (only adapted if the mock change breaks it); see D-06 in 04-CONTEXT.md.
   - What we know: REQ-AUD-test-infra's literal wording ("hooks are tested with `renderHook`") is already satisfied by 5 other hook test files phase 1.2 added; this file is the one large holdout (751 lines, spy-based).
   - What's unclear: whether the phase's success criterion 4 ("hooks are tested with `renderHook`") is meant to require *all* hook tests to use it, or just to establish the pattern (which it already has).
   - Recommendation: treat criterion 4 as satisfied by the existing `renderHook`-based files plus the new default real-SQL mock; leave `useSurveySync.test.ts` as a stretch goal / separate plan item, not a blocking task, unless the owner explicitly wants it in scope now (it is 751 lines and a full rewrite risk is disproportionate to a CI-hardening phase).

2. **Fix `expo-doctor`'s two findings, or suppress them?** — **RESOLVED:** fixed, not suppressed; see D-02 in 04-CONTEXT.md and plan 01.3-03 (removes the invalid `newArchEnabled` key, resolves the Metro finding).
   - What we know: `app.json`'s `newArchEnabled` key fails schema validation; `metro.config.js`'s `disableHierarchicalLookup: true` differs from the Expo-recommended default, with an inline comment explaining it's deliberate (pins module resolution to the mobile workspace in this monorepo).
   - What's unclear: whether `newArchEnabled` is meant to be removed outright (New Architecture is enabled some other way, or not needed) or whether this is a stale/misplaced key that predates the current Expo 57 config surface; whether the Metro override is still necessary given `expo/metro-config`'s current defaults.
   - Recommendation: this phase's task list must include actually resolving these two `expo-doctor` findings (not just wiring the CI job around them), since criterion 6 explicitly says "mobile changes run `expo-doctor`" — a permanently-red check defeats the purpose. Investigate `app.json`'s `newArchEnabled` key's origin/necessity and Metro's monorepo resolution requirement as a first task in the mobile-build wave.

3. **`api/package.json`'s exact `test:e2e` / `test:e2e:coverage` script content and migration ordering** — **RESOLVED:** see D-08 in 04-CONTEXT.md and 04-02-PLAN.md Tasks 1–2: the scripts were read (`npm run migrate && jest …`); the `npm run migrate` prefix is removed and Jest `globalSetup` itself drops the schema and runs `runMigrations(config)` against the dedicated `*_test` database before any spec, so there is no race and no migration of the dev database. — needs to be read directly during planning (not fully captured here) to correctly sequence a `globalSetup` DB reset. This research could not run the E2E suite in this sandbox (no Docker/Postgres available — see Environment Availability), so the DB-reset ordering pitfall (Pitfall 4) is flagged rather than fully resolved.

## Environment Availability

| Dependency | Required By | Available | Version | Fallback |
|------------|--------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Node.js | Everything | ✓ | 22.22.2 | — |
| npm | Everything | ✓ | 10.9.7 | — |
| `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) | Mobile real-SQL storage tests | ✓ | Built into Node 22.22.2 (experimental) | `better-sqlite3` if the experimental flag ever becomes a blocker (not recommended now) |
| Docker | Image build/run validation, E2E Postgres service | ✗ (not available in this research sandbox) | — | Validate the Dockerfile changes in CI itself (the GitHub Actions runner has Docker); local `docker build` validation must happen on the owner's machine or in CI, not in this sandbox |
| PostgreSQL | E2E tests, DB-reset `globalSetup` verification | ✗ (no local instance, no Docker to start one) | — | E2E behavior must be verified in CI (which does provision a `postgres:16` service container) rather than in this research session |
| `git ls-remote` over HTTPS | Resolving Action SHAs | ✓ | — | — |
| GitHub REST API (`api.github.com`) | Confirming repo visibility, resolving SHAs via API | ✗ (blocked: "GitHub access to this repository is not enabled for this session") | — | Used `git ls-remote --tags` and a plain unauthenticated `curl https://api.github.com/repos/...` (works for public read-only repo metadata) instead |
| `npx expo-doctor` / `npx expo export` | `mobile-build` CI job | ✓ | `expo-doctor@1.20.4` (self-installed via npx, not persisted to `package.json`) | — |

**Missing dependencies with no fallback:**
- None — every gap above (Docker, Postgres) has a documented fallback (verify in CI instead of locally).

**Missing dependencies with fallback:**
- Docker / Postgres: verify Dockerfile and E2E DB-reset behavior in the actual GitHub Actions run (which does have both), not in this research sandbox.

## Validation Architecture

### Test Framework

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework (api) | Jest 29 + ts-jest, config `api/jest.unit.config.js` (unit) / `api/jest.config.js` (E2E) |
| Framework (mobile) | Jest 29 + ts-jest, config `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` |
| Quick run command (api) | `npm --workspace api run test:unit` |
| Quick run command (mobile) | `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` |
| Full suite command | `npm test` (= `test:unit` then `test:e2e`, requires a running Postgres) |

### Phase Requirements → Test Map

| Req ID | Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists? |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline (typecheck gate) | A deliberate type error fails CI | CI smoke (throwaway branch) | Introduce a one-line type error on a throwaway branch, open a PR, confirm `check` job fails | N/A — verified by exercising the actual CI, not a repo test file |
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline (path filtering) | Docs-only PR runs only `check` | CI smoke | Open a PR touching only a `.md` file, confirm `unit`/`e2e`/`mobile-build` show as skipped and `ci-ok` still passes | N/A |
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline (SHA pinning, permissions, timeouts, concurrency) | Workflow YAML structure | Static check | `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml` (not installed in this sandbox; install via `go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest` or the `raven-actions/actionlint` action) + manual read of the YAML for `permissions:`, `timeout-minutes:`, `concurrency:`, and 40-char SHAs on every `uses:` line | ❌ Wave 0 — actionlint not currently run anywhere in this repo |
| REQ-AUD-reproducible-image (root lockfile, non-root, tags) | Image reflects root lockfile; runs non-root; tagged by SHA+latest | Build-time smoke | `docker build -f api/Dockerfile .` then `docker run --rm <image> id` (expect non-root uid) and `docker run --rm <image> npm ls --workspace api 2>/dev/null \|\| true` (or inspect installed versions against `package-lock.json`) | ❌ Wave 0 — no test exercises the Dockerfile today |
| REQ-AUD-reproducible-image (push only from main) | `workflow_dispatch`/PR runs never push | CI smoke | Trigger `workflow_dispatch` from a non-`main` branch, confirm the `build` job's `if:` skips it | N/A |
| REQ-AUD-test-infra (real SQL) | Storage tests execute real SQL | Unit | `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- storage.test.ts` after rewiring the mock — a deliberately broken SQL string in `storage.ts` must fail this test (currently would NOT, since it's spy-based) | ⚠️ Exists but must be rewritten (`mobile/src/storage.test.ts`) |
| REQ-AUD-test-infra (`.tsx` collection) | `.test.tsx` files are picked up | Static/CI smoke | `npx jest --config mobile/jest.unit.config.js --listTests \| grep '\.test\.tsx$'` — currently returns nothing (no `.test.tsx` files exist yet, and `testMatch` excludes them); after the fix, create one throwaway `.test.tsx` file and confirm `--listTests` includes it | ❌ Wave 0 — no `.tsx` test exists to prove collection today |
| REQ-AUD-test-infra (E2E DB reset) | DB is reset before each run | E2E | Run `npm run test:e2e` twice in a row against the same Postgres without any manual cleanup; both runs must pass identically (today, per audit finding T5, uniqueness relies on `Date.now()`, which is a symptom of the DB never being reset) | ❌ Wave 0 — needs a `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown` file, none exists |
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline (coverage ratchet) | Coverage runs with per-directory thresholds | CI | `npm run test:coverage:api` / `test:coverage:mobile` with `coverageThreshold` configured; a deliberate coverage drop below threshold must fail | ⚠️ Coverage scripts exist; `coverageThreshold` blocks do not exist in any config yet |
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline (mobile build check) | `expo-doctor`/`expo export` run in CI | CI | `npx expo-doctor` (must exit 0 after the two current findings are fixed) and `npx expo export --platform android` (verified this session to already succeed) | ❌ Wave 0 — not run in CI today, and `expo-doctor` currently fails |
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline (audit gate) | `npm audit` fails CI at `high` | CI | `npm audit --audit-level=high` (verified this session: exits 0 today — no high/critical findings exist, so the gate starts green) | ✓ works today, just not wired into CI |
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline (CodeQL) | CodeQL scans JS/TS | CI (separate workflow) | New `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` using `github/codeql-action` `init`/`autobuild`/`analyze` for the `javascript-typescript` language | ❌ Wave 0 — no CodeQL workflow exists; repo is public, so no GitHub Advanced Security license is needed (confirmed `"private": false` via the public GitHub API) |

### Sampling Rate
- **Per task commit:** the relevant quick-run command for whichever workspace/config was touched (`npm --workspace api run test:unit`, `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit`, or for workflow-only changes, `actionlint` + a throwaway-branch smoke test).
- **Per wave merge:** `npm run test:unit` (both workspaces) plus a manual review of the actual GitHub Actions run for the wave's PR (since much of this phase's "test" is the CI system itself, not code covered by Jest).
- **Phase gate:** a real PR exercising every criterion — deliberate type error (must fail), docs-only diff (must skip expensive jobs), a `.tsx` test file (must be collected), two consecutive E2E runs (must both pass) — before `/gsd:verify-work`.

### Wave 0 Gaps
- [ ] `actionlint` is not installed or run anywhere — install via `go install` or the `raven-actions/actionlint-action` GitHub Action; add as a step in `check` or as its own lightweight job.
- [ ] No Jest `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown` file exists for E2E DB reset — needs a new `api/test/global-setup.ts` (or `.js`, matching `api/jest.config.js`'s existing all-JS convention) wired via the `globalSetup` key.
- [ ] No `coverageThreshold` block exists in either `api/jest.unit.config.js` or `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` — this phase adds both, seeded from the measured values in this research (re-measure at execution time since phase 01.3's own test changes will shift the numbers slightly).
- [ ] No `.dockerignore` exists anywhere in the repo — needed at the repo root once the build context becomes `.` (should exclude `node_modules`, `mobile/`, `.git`, `dist`, `coverage`).
- [ ] `.github/dependabot.yml` has no `github-actions` ecosystem entry — needed so SHA-pinned actions get automated bump PRs (otherwise SHA-pinning becomes a maintenance trap).

## Security Domain

### Applicable ASVS Categories

| ASVS Category | Applies | Standard Control |
|----------------|---------|--------------------|
| V1 Architecture / Secure SDLC | yes | This entire phase — verified builds, verified images, CI gates |
| V14 Configuration (build & deploy) | yes | Least-privilege `permissions:` block, SHA-pinned third-party actions, non-root container user, image tagged/pushed only from `main` |
| V10 Malicious code (supply chain) | yes | CodeQL scanning, `npm audit` gate, Dependabot for both `npm` and (new) `github-actions` ecosystems |
| V6 Cryptography | no | Nothing in this phase touches cryptographic code |
| V2/V3 Authentication/Session | no | Out of scope — this phase is CI/build infrastructure, not app auth logic |

### Known Threat Patterns for this stack

| Pattern | STRIDE | Standard Mitigation |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| Compromised/re-tagged third-party GitHub Action | Tampering | SHA-pin every third-party `uses:` (`dorny/paths-filter`, `docker/*`, `github/codeql-action`); Dependabot `github-actions` ecosystem to keep pins current |
| `workflow_dispatch` from an arbitrary branch pushing `:latest` to production | Elevation of Privilege | `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` gate on the `build` job (already partially true for the non-dispatch path; the audit's CI-2 finding is specifically that `workflow_dispatch` bypasses this today) |
| Overly broad `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions letting a compromised dependency exfiltrate repo contents or write packages | Information Disclosure / Tampering | Workflow-level `permissions: contents: read`, with `packages: write` granted only on the specific `build` job that needs it (already scoped correctly on `build` today; needs to be added at the top level for every other job, which currently has no `permissions:` block at all, defaulting to the repo's broader default) |
| Vulnerable transitive dependency reaching production | Tampering | `npm audit --audit-level=high` in CI; today 0 high/critical findings, 20 moderate (mostly Expo's dev-tooling chain — `@expo/cli`/`@expo/config-plugins` transitive `uuid`/`xcode`), none of which reach the API's production image (confirmed: `npm ci --workspace api --omit=dev` installs no `expo`/`xcode`/`uuid`-chain packages at all) |
| Malicious/vulnerable JS/TS code shipped in a PR | Tampering | CodeQL `javascript-typescript` analysis, weekly + on every PR, per the remediation plan |

## Owner decisions needed

1. **`npm audit --audit-level=high` scope: all dependencies, or `--omit=dev` (production only)?**
   - Both currently pass (0 high/critical findings either way, verified this session).
   - Option A: audit the full tree (including devDependencies/Expo tooling) — catches vulnerabilities in the toolchain itself (e.g., a compromised build tool), at the cost of more noise from Expo's fast-moving canary-tagged transitive deps.
   - Option B: audit `--omit=dev` only — scoped to what actually ships to users/production, quieter, but blind to a compromised dev dependency (e.g., a malicious ESLint plugin).
   - **Recommendation:** Option A (audit everything) at `--audit-level=high`. High/critical findings are rare enough that noise isn't a real concern (proven by today's clean run), and dev-tooling supply-chain attacks are a real, documented category (e.g., historical npm postinstall-script attacks). The 20 moderate findings visible today do not block either option.

2. **`expo-doctor`'s two current failures — fix now or explicitly accept for this phase?**
   - `app.json`'s `newArchEnabled` key isn't in Expo's config schema; `metro.config.js`'s `disableHierarchicalLookup: true` deviates from Expo's recommended default (with an existing inline comment explaining the monorepo reason).
   - Option A: investigate and fix both before wiring the CI job, so `mobile-build` starts green.
   - Option B: wire the CI job now and accept it starting red, tracked as a fast-follow.
   - **Recommendation:** Option A. A CI gate that's red on day one for reasons unrelated to the PR that triggers it trains everyone to ignore it — the opposite of this phase's goal. This is a small, contained investigation (two config values), not a big detour.

3. **CodeQL: separate scheduled workflow, or folded into `ci.yml`?**
   - The remediation plan recommends a **separate** `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, weekly + on PRs. This repo is confirmed public (`"private": false` via the GitHub API), so CodeQL is free — no GitHub Advanced Security purchase needed, removing what would otherwise be a real owner decision.
   - **Recommendation:** separate workflow file, exactly as the remediation plan suggests — CodeQL's own runtime (often several minutes) shouldn't block the fast `ci-ok` aggregate that gates merges.

4. **Should the root `package.json`'s `expo`/`react`/`react-native` dependencies eventually move into `mobile/package.json`?**
   - Not required for this phase (the Dockerfile fix works around it by simply not passing `--include-workspace-root`), but it's the root cause of why that flag is dangerous at all, and it's an unusual structure for an npm workspaces monorepo (root packages normally hold only shared tooling, not one workspace's runtime deps).
   - **Recommendation:** defer to a later hygiene phase (01.9 already covers "root runtime dependencies... are gone" per its success criterion 5) — flagging here so the planner doesn't feel obligated to fix it now, and so 01.9's plan inherits this context.

5. **Branch protection configuration (cannot be done by an agent — requires GitHub repo Settings access):**
   - The owner must, after this phase's `ci-ok` job exists and has run at least once successfully:
     1. Go to **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules** for `main`.
     2. Add/edit the rule for `main`.
     3. Under "Require status checks to pass before merging," enable it and search for/select **`CI OK`** (the `ci-ok` job's `name:`) as the single required check — do not select the individual `check`/`unit`/`e2e`/`mobile-build`/`audit` jobs, since those are conditionally skipped and GitHub would otherwise block merges on jobs that never ran.
     4. Optionally enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging" if linear history matters.
     5. Save.
   - This is a one-time, ~2-minute manual step with no CLI/API equivalent that an agent should perform unattended (branch protection changes are a security-sensitive repo setting).

- `docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md` L5, L6, L7 — near-executable remediation detail for each finding
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (read directly, current state)
- `api/Dockerfile`, `infra/vps/update-stack.sh`, `infra/vps/README.md`, `infra/docker-compose.vps.yml` (read directly — VPS pull-based deploy mechanics)

- Live command execution this session: `npm run typecheck`, `npm audit --audit-level=high` (with and without `--omit=dev`), `npm run test:coverage:api`, `npm run test:coverage:mobile`, `npx expo-doctor`, `npx expo export --platform android`, `git ls-remote --tags` for 8 GitHub Actions, a build-context simulation of `npm ci --workspace api` with/without `--include-workspace-root`
- `curl https://api.github.com/repos/florianlepont/cortege` — confirmed `"private": false"`, `"visibility": "public"`

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)
- None used beyond the above — this phase's domain is fully covered by direct repo inspection and live command execution, no web-sourced claims were needed for the core recommendations

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- None

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH — every version/SHA verified live this session against official sources (npm registry via installed `package.json`, GitHub tags via `git ls-remote`)
- Architecture: HIGH — the target workflow structure is the audit's own design for this exact repo, cross-checked against the current `ci.yml`
- Pitfalls: HIGH — every pitfall (image bloat, `expo-doctor` failures, `changes` job PR-gating, coverage baseline) was reproduced live in this session, not inferred

**Measured this session (2026-09-24, Node 22.22.2, npm 10.9.7):**
- `npm run typecheck` → passes clean (mobile `tsc --noEmit` + api `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`)
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` → exit 0, 20 moderate findings, 0 high/critical (same with `--omit=dev`, still 0 high/critical)
- `npm run test:coverage:api` (unit only — E2E coverage failed for lack of a local Postgres) → Statements 45.97%, Branches 24.51%, Functions 32.06%, Lines 45.23%; 98 tests / 10 suites, 8.4s
- `npm run test:coverage:mobile` → Statements 51.44%, Branches 30.51%, Functions 41.41%, Lines 52.2%; 497 tests / 39 suites, 14.2s
- `npx expo-doctor` (mobile/) → 19/21 checks pass; 2 failures: `app.json` `newArchEnabled` schema violation, `metro.config.js` `resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup` mismatch
- `npx expo export --platform android` (mobile/) → succeeds, ~22s bundle, 1324 modules, no network calls beyond local bundling
- `npm ci --workspace api --include-workspace-root=true` (simulated in `/tmp`, root context, no `mobile/` present) → 1071 packages, 529 MB `node_modules`, includes `expo`/`react`/`react-native`
- `npm ci --workspace api` (no `--include-workspace-root` flag) → far smaller `node_modules` (215 MB with devDeps, 133 MB with `--omit=dev`), **no** `expo`/`react`/`react-native` present
- `git ls-remote --tags` resolved current SHAs for all 8 GitHub Actions used or newly introduced (see Standard Stack table)
- Repository confirmed public via `curl https://api.github.com/repos/florianlepont/cortege`

**No files were modified by this research.** `git status --porcelain` was checked clean before and after every probe; `mobile/dist/` (created by `expo export`) was removed after inspection.

**Research date:** 2026-09-24
**Valid until:** ~14 days for the action SHAs (upstream patch releases are frequent; re-resolve via `git ls-remote` at plan/execution time rather than trusting the pinned values verbatim if execution is delayed), ~30 days for everything else (coverage baselines should be re-measured at execution time regardless, since phase 01.3's own changes will shift them before the `coverageThreshold` blocks are written).
