# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 04-ci-and-test-safety-net
    provides: "plan 02's ibp_test E2E database + repo-root api/Dockerfile; plan 03's EXPO_DOCTOR_VERSION=1.20.4"
provides:
  - "Single-atomic-rewrite ci.yml: changes (runs on PRs), check (lint/format/typecheck/actionlint), unit-api/unit-mobile (coverage + lcov artifacts), e2e (two runs, sentinel-proven reset), mobile-build (expo-doctor/expo export), audit (npm audit --audit-level=high), image-check (root-context Dockerfile build + 4 smoke tests, no push), ci-ok (single required aggregate), build (main-only SHA-tagged push under a non-cancelling deploy-image concurrency group)"
  - "Separate .github/workflows/codeql.yml: javascript-typescript CodeQL on PRs, main pushes and a weekly schedule"
  - "Dependabot github-actions ecosystem entry so SHA-pinned actions get bump PRs"
affects: [01.3-06, 01.3-07]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Path-filter gating: changes job runs unconditionally (including on PRs); dependent jobs gate on `needs.changes.outputs.<x> == 'true' || needs.changes.outputs.shared == 'true'`; a job-level if: cannot read matrix context, so unit-api/unit-mobile are two separate jobs rather than a matrix"
    - "Single required check: ci-ok aggregates every job's needs.<job>.result via step env vars (no ${{ }} inside the script body) and treats skipped as success, success as success, anything else as failure"
    - "Image build reused twice: image-check builds+smoke-tests api/Dockerfile with push: false/load: true on every PR touching image paths; build re-builds and pushes only on main pushes after ci-ok, under concurrency group deploy-image with cancel-in-progress: false so a half-pushed image is never left behind"

key-decisions:

  - "workflow_dispatch removed entirely (was the audit's CI-2 bypass — let any branch push :latest on demand); the image can now only reach :latest via a main-branch push"
  - "E2E and image-check both target the ibp_test database introduced in plan 02; PGPASSWORD is set in the e2e job env so the sentinel-plant/assert psql commands do not need -W or a .pgpass file"
  - "actionlint v1.7.12 is downloaded and sha256-verified in the check job rather than installed via a Go toolchain, matching the plan's verification recipe and avoiding an extra Go setup step in CI"

# Phase 01.3 Plan 05: CI pipeline rewrite, CodeQL and Dependabot pin maintenance Summary

**Rewrote `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in one atomic change around path filters and a single `CI OK` aggregate gate — adding typecheck, coverage artifacts, a proven-twice E2E reset, an expo-doctor/expo-export mobile check, `npm audit --audit-level=high`, a non-pushing image smoke test, and a main-only SHA-tagged image push — plus a separate CodeQL workflow and a Dependabot `github-actions` entry.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~25 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-24T09:44:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-24T09:48:38Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 3 (1 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` fully replaced: old jobs (`quality`, `test-unit-api`, `test-unit-mobile`, `test-e2e-api`, gated `changes`, `build`) are gone; new jobs are `changes`, `check`, `unit-api`, `unit-mobile`, `e2e`, `mobile-build`, `audit`, `image-check`, `ci-ok`, `build`
- `changes` now runs on PRs too (fixes audit finding CI-3 — the old `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'` made path filtering a no-op on PRs)
- `check` adds `npm run typecheck` and a sha256-verified `actionlint` run (verified locally: `actionlint v1.7.12` reports zero errors on both workflow files)
- `unit-api`/`unit-mobile` run `test:unit:coverage` and upload `coverage-api`/`coverage-mobile` lcov artifacts (14-day retention)
- `e2e` runs `npm run test:e2e` twice against the same `ibp_test` Postgres service, planting an `e2e_reset_sentinel` table between runs and asserting it is gone afterward — proves plan 02's Jest `globalSetup` reset (D-08) actually resets on every run, not just the first
- `mobile-build` runs the exact `expo-doctor@1.20.4` pin recorded in `04-03-SUMMARY.md`, then `expo export --platform android`
- `audit` runs `npm audit --audit-level=high` with no `--omit=dev` (D-01: all dependencies, not just production)
- `image-check` builds `api/Dockerfile` from the repo root (`context: .`) without pushing, then smoke-tests: non-root `id -u`, absence of `node_modules/expo`/`node_modules/react-native`, a healthcheck configured against `/v1/health`, and a live container answering `GET /v1/health` within 60s
- `ci-ok` is the single required status check: fails unless `changes`/`check`/`audit` are `success` and `unit-api`/`unit-mobile`/`e2e`/`mobile-build`/`image-check` are each `success` or `skipped`
- `build` pushes `ghcr.io/florianlepont/cortege:latest` and `:sha-${{ github.sha }}` only on `main` pushes, after `ci-ok`, under `concurrency: group: deploy-image` with `cancel-in-progress: false` (T-01.3-19)
- Every `uses:` pinned to a 40-character commit SHA with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment; workflow-level `permissions: contents: read`; `pull-requests: read` only on `changes`; `packages: write` only on `build`; `security-events: write` only on CodeQL's `analyze`
- `workflow_dispatch` removed (was the audit's CI-2 finding — any branch could push `:latest` on demand); `pull_request_target` never used
- New `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`: `javascript-typescript` analysis on PRs, main pushes and a weekly Monday 03:00 UTC cron, kept out of the `ci-ok` aggregate per D-03
- `.github/dependabot.yml` gets a second `github-actions` ecosystem entry (`open-pull-requests-limit: 5`, unlike the npm block's `0`) so the SHA pins above get bump PRs instead of silently going stale

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Rewrite ci.yml (changes, check, unit, e2e, mobile-build, audit, image-check, CI OK, build)** - `42e6176` (feat)
2. **Task 2: CodeQL workflow and Dependabot github-actions entry** - `39ca041` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** committed separately by the orchestrator after wave merge (per parallel-executor instructions, this agent does not touch STATE.md/ROADMAP.md)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Full atomic rewrite: 10 jobs, path filters, single `CI OK` gate, coverage artifacts, proven E2E reset, mobile build check, dependency audit, non-pushing image smoke test, main-only SHA-tagged push
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` - New: `javascript-typescript` CodeQL analysis on PRs, main and a weekly schedule
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Added `github-actions` ecosystem entry (weekly, limit 5); existing `npm` block (limit 0) untouched

## Decisions Made

- Two unit jobs instead of a matrix (plan's interfaces block flagged this: a job-level `if:` can't read matrix context for per-workspace skipping)
- `workflow_dispatch` dropped entirely rather than gated, closing the audit's CI-2 bypass at the trigger level instead of only at the `if:` level
- `PGPASSWORD: ibp` added to the `e2e` job env (not in the plan's literal env-block list, but required for the plan's own `psql` sentinel-plant/assert steps to authenticate non-interactively) — Rule 3 (blocking fix, not a package install)
- `actionlint` downloaded as the pinned release tarball with a sha256 check in the `check` job, matching the plan's verification recipe exactly (not a `go install` step, which was only used for local proof in this sandbox)

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking fix] Added `PGPASSWORD: ibp` to the `e2e` job env**
- **Found during:** Task 1, while wiring the `psql` sentinel-plant and reset-assert steps
- **Issue:** The plan's literal E2E env block (carried over from plan 02/the interfaces section) does not include a `PGPASSWORD`; without it, the `psql -h localhost -U ibp -d ibp_test ...` steps the same task specifies would prompt for a password and hang/fail non-interactively in CI
- **Fix:** Added `PGPASSWORD: ibp` to the `e2e` job's `env:` block (matches the existing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ibp` value already in that block and in the Postgres service definition)
- **Files modified:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Commit:** `42e6176`

No other deviations — the rest of the plan (job list, names, timeouts, permissions, pins, path filters, image-check smoke tests, `ci-ok` logic, `build` gating) was implemented exactly as specified.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the YAML quoting fix below (not a plan deviation, just a syntax correction while authoring the file):
- The first draft of the `check` job's `Run actionlint` step used `run: "$RUNNER_TEMP/actionlint" .github/workflows/*.yml`, which YAML parses as an invalid flow scalar (a value starting with `"` must be a single complete quoted string). Fixed by wrapping the whole command in single quotes: `run: '"$RUNNER_TEMP/actionlint" .github/workflows/*.yml'`. Caught immediately by a local `js-yaml` parse before any commit.

## Local Proof (no GitHub Actions runner here; CI-only criteria verified in plan 06/07)

Ran locally in the worktree:
- `node -e "yaml.load(...)"` structural check: all 10 `ci.yml` jobs present with `timeout-minutes`, workflow `permissions.contents === 'read'`, `ci-ok` job `name === 'CI OK'` — **PASS**
- `GOBIN=/tmp/actionlint-bin go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@v1.7.12` then `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml` and `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml` — **zero errors, both invocations**
- All plan-specified `grep` acceptance checks run against the final `ci.yml`/`codeql.yml`/`dependabot.yml` — every count matched the plan's expected value (unpinned `uses:` = 0; `typecheck` = 1; `audit --audit-level=high` = 1; `omit=dev` = 0; `event_name != 'pull_request'` = 0; `workflow_dispatch` = 0; `pull_request_target` = 0; `packages: write` = 1; `group: deploy-image` = 1; `cancel-in-progress: false` = 1; `cortege:latest` = 1; `cortege:sha-${{ github.sha }}` = 1; `file: api/Dockerfile` = 2; `e2e_reset_sentinel` = 2; `npm run test:e2e` = 2; bare `POSTGRES_DB: ibp` = 0; `POSTGRES_DB: ibp_test` = 3; `-d ibp_test` = 2; `expo-doctor@` = 1; `expo export --platform android` = 1; old job ids = 0; `codeql.yml` `javascript-typescript` ≥ 1, `security-events: write` = 1, unpinned `uses:` = 0, `cron:` = 1; `dependabot.yml` `github-actions` entry present alongside the untouched `npm` `open-pull-requests-limit: 0`)
- No Docker daemon and no `gh` CLI available in this sandbox, per the parallel-execution note — the E2E-twice reset proof, the image-check smoke tests (non-root, no mobile deps, healthcheck, live `/v1/health`), the docs-only-PR path-filter skip, and the CodeQL run itself are all **pending-CI**, to be verified on the phase PR in plan 06/07 as the plan's own `<verification>` section states

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. CI secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) are provided automatically by GitHub Actions; no new repository secrets were introduced.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 06/07 can open the phase PR and verify on GitHub: every job runs on a workflow-file-touching PR (shared path), `CI OK` goes green, `build` is skipped (not a main push), the E2E job proves the sentinel reset twice, `image-check` passes all four smoke tests, `mobile-build` passes `expo-doctor@1.20.4` and `expo export`, and the new CodeQL workflow completes successfully
- No blockers identified for downstream plans in this wave
