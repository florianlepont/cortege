# Dependency graph
requires: []
provides:
  - mobile/app.json without the invalid newArchEnabled schema key
  - mobile/metro.config.js without dead/obsolete resolver overrides, relying on Expo's default monorepo handling
  - EXPO_DOCTOR_VERSION pin (1.20.4) for plan 05's CI job
  - Prebuild config diff record for plan 06's owner device check
affects: [01.3-05 (mobile-build CI job), 01.3-06 (owner device smoke test)]

# Tech tracking

key-decisions:
  - "EXPO_DOCTOR_VERSION pinned to 1.20.4 (resolved via `npm view expo-doctor version`), reused by plan 05's CI job"
  - "Removed metro.config.js's resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup, resolver.nodeModulesPaths and resolver.extraNodeModules entirely rather than tuning them, since react/react-native are hoisted to the root node_modules and the extraNodeModules targets (mobile/node_modules/react, mobile/node_modules/react-native) never existed on disk"

patterns-established:
  - "Metro config: keep only getDefaultConfig(__dirname) output for npm-workspaces monorepos; do not add resolver.extraNodeModules/nodeModulesPaths without verifying the target paths actually exist"

# Phase 01.3 Plan 03: Fix expo-doctor failures (newArchEnabled + Metro resolver) Summary

**Removed the invalid `newArchEnabled` key from app.json and the dead Metro resolver overrides from metro.config.js, taking expo-doctor from 20/21 to 21/21 passing checks with proof that the exported Android bundle still contains exactly one copy of react and react-native, both before and after.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 35 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-24T09:02:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-24T09:37:29Z
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- `mobile/app.json`: deleted `"newArchEnabled": true` (no longer part of the Expo SDK 57 / RN 0.86 config schema; New Architecture is always on)
- `mobile/metro.config.js`: removed `resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup`, `resolver.nodeModulesPaths`, and `resolver.extraNodeModules`, relying on `getDefaultConfig(__dirname)`'s built-in monorepo handling
- `npx expo-doctor@1.20.4`: 20/21 → 21/21 checks passing
- Proved via source-map inspection of `npx expo export --platform android --source-maps` that the bundle contains exactly 1 copy of `react/index.js` and 1 copy of `react-native/index.js`, identical before and after the Metro change
- `npm --workspace mobile run typecheck`, `test:unit` (497 tests, 39 suites), and `lint` all exit 0 after the change

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove newArchEnabled and record the prebuild config impact** - `17b4dd7` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Metro config that passes expo-doctor with a single React copy** - `bb07943` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** committed separately by the orchestrator after wave merge (per parallel-executor instructions, this agent does not touch STATE.md/ROADMAP.md)

## Files Created/Modified

- `mobile/app.json` - Removed the invalid `newArchEnabled` key (1 line deleted, 0 added)
- `mobile/metro.config.js` - Removed dead resolver overrides (disableHierarchicalLookup, nodeModulesPaths, extraNodeModules); kept only `getDefaultConfig(__dirname)` plus an explanatory comment

## Decisions Made

- **EXPO_DOCTOR_VERSION = 1.20.4** — resolved once via `npm view expo-doctor version` in mobile/, used for every expo-doctor invocation in this plan. Plan 05 should pin this same version in the CI job.
- **Native prebuild config changed: yes (key only)** — comparing `npx expo config --type prebuild --json` before and after deleting `newArchEnabled` from `mobile/app.json`, the only difference in the resolved prebuild config is that the `newArchEnabled` key itself disappears (`true` → `undefined`). No other field in the prebuild config changed; `./plugins/with-scene-delegate` still resolves cleanly in both runs. This is the fact plan 06's owner device check should note: the change is a schema cleanup with no other observable native-config effect, but new architecture status on device should still be part of the smoke test.
- **Metro override removal is safe, not just cosmetic** — `mobile/node_modules/react` and `mobile/node_modules/react-native` do not exist (react/react-native are hoisted to the root `node_modules`, pinned there by root `package.json`'s dependencies + overrides), so `resolver.extraNodeModules` was pointing at nonexistent paths before this change. Removing it did not change what Metro actually resolved — confirmed by the identical single-copy count (1 react, 1 react-native) in the source maps before and after.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. The plan's fallback clause (restore + checkpoint if no config passes both expo-doctor and the export/single-copy proof) was not triggered: the target state described in the plan passed expo-doctor, `expo export`, the single-copy check, typecheck, test:unit, and lint on the first attempt.

## Issues Encountered

- `npm ci` had to be run first in the worktree (node_modules was absent), per the parallel-executor fallback instructions. No dependency or lockfile changes were made.
- `npx expo export --help` was checked to confirm the source-maps flag name (`-s, --source-maps [mode]`, used as the bare `--source-maps` flag) before running the proof steps, since the plan flagged this as potentially differing by Expo CLI version.

## Proof commands and output (for plan 05 / plan 06 reference)

**Before (original metro.config.js):**
```
$ npx --yes expo-doctor@1.20.4
Running 21 checks on your project...
20/21 checks passed. 1 checks failed.
✖ Check for issues with Metro config
- "resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup" mismatch. Expected false, got: true

$ npx expo export --platform android --source-maps  → exit 0
Single-copy check: react/index.js distinct=1, react-native/index.js distinct=1
```

**After (this plan's metro.config.js):**
```
$ npx --yes expo-doctor@1.20.4
Running 21 checks on your project...
21/21 checks passed. No issues detected!

$ npx expo export --platform android --source-maps  → exit 0
Single-copy check: react/index.js distinct=1, react-native/index.js distinct=1

$ npm --workspace mobile run typecheck  → exit 0
$ npm --workspace mobile run test:unit  → 39 suites, 497 tests passed
$ npm --workspace mobile run lint       → exit 0 (no output)
```

No `mobile/dist` directory was left in the working tree; all export runs used scratchpad output directories outside the repo.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 05 (mobile-build CI job) can now wire `npx expo-doctor@1.20.4` and `npx expo export --platform android` expecting both to exit 0 from the current tree.
- Plan 06's owner device check should verify New Architecture behaves correctly on-device now that the key is no longer explicit in app.json (it defaults to on in SDK 57 / RN 0.86 regardless), and can rely on this plan's record that no other prebuild config field changed.
