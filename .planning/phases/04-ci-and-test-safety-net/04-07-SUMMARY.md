# Phase 01.3 Plan 07: Post-merge phase gate Summary

**The first main push after the merge ran CI OK green and pushed `ghcr.io/florianlepont/cortege:latest` plus `:sha-4ac6b78…`. The throwaway PR proved both gating behaviours. The VPS picked up the non-root image: health answers 200 and photo upload still works.**

## Accomplishments

- Main run https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36017011749: every job success, image pushed with `latest` and `sha-4ac6b78c84c7ba07090fb0385325a20044e60a4d`.
- Docs-only proof https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36017112643: unit, E2E, mobile build and image check skipped; CI OK success.
- Type-error proof https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36017507799: Typecheck failed, CI OK failed.
- Branch protection on `main` requires `["CI OK"]` (checked through the public API).
- VPS: `https://cortege.algernon.ovh/v1/health` returns 200 (checked by the owner and the agent); the owner added a photo to a survey from the app and it displayed, so the non-root container can still write attachments.

## Deviations from Plan

1. Proofs ran on the phase branch through PR #135 instead of `ci-proof/*` branches (session push scope). Same evidence, proof commits removed after.
2. Branch protection was switched during plan 06 (it was blocking the merge), not at the end of this plan.

## Issues Encountered

None.
