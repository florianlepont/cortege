# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.2
    provides: mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts (createNodeSqliteDb helper wrapping node:sqlite behind the expo-sqlite async API)
provides:
  - Global expo-sqlite Jest mock that executes real SQL by default (node:sqlite) instead of jest.fn() stubs
  - mobile/jest.unit.config.js with a single moduleNameMapper block and .test.tsx in testMatch
  - Proof that .test.tsx files are collected and the JSX transform works with renderHook's wrapper option
  - storage.test.ts rewritten to assert on real table state (49 tests), with a sabotage run proving a broken INSERT fails the suite
  - Root package.json engines.node >=22.5.0 floor for node:sqlite
affects: [01.3-02, 01.3-03, 01.3-04, 01.3-05, 01.3-06, 01.3-07, 01.4, 01.5]

    - "Storage tests seed real rows via public functions or direct INSERT, then SELECT and assert on table state — never mockResolvedValue"
    - "renderHook with a JSX wrapper: jest.mock(\"react-native\") plain-object factory before importing @testing-library/react-native/pure, cleanup() in afterEach"

  - "Root package.json declares engines.node >=22.5.0 for node:sqlite's DatabaseSync; package-lock.json synced with only the 3-line engines block"

# Phase 01.3 Plan 01: Real-SQL test default and .test.tsx collection Summary

**Rewired the global expo-sqlite Jest mock to run real SQL via node:sqlite, collected `.test.tsx` files, and rewrote storage.test.ts (49 tests) to assert on table state — a sabotage run confirms a broken INSERT now fails the suite.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~35 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 6 (1 created, 5 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `mobile/test/expo-sqlite.mock.ts` now returns a fresh `createNodeSqliteDb()` per `openDatabaseAsync` call instead of a `jest.fn()` stub, so every mobile unit test that opens the local DB runs real SQL by default
- Fixed the shadowed duplicate `moduleNameMapper` block in `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` and added `.test.tsx` to `testMatch`
- Added `mobile/src/hooks/render-hook-wrapper.test.tsx` proving `.tsx` collection and the JSX transform work end to end with `renderHook`'s `wrapper` option
- Rewrote `mobile/src/storage.test.ts` (49 tests, was 48): removed the local `jest.mock("expo-sqlite")` factory, `mockDb`, and `getRunAsyncPayload`; every test now seeds real rows and asserts on resulting `SELECT` state
- Added an `"expo-sqlite test double"` guard test asserting a statement against a nonexistent table rejects
- Verified with a sabotage run: truncating `site_name` to `site_nam` in the `local_surveys` INSERT (`surveys.ts`) made 6 tests fail with `table local_surveys has no column named site_nam`; reverted cleanly
- Root `package.json` declares `engines.node >=22.5.0`; `package-lock.json` synced with exactly a 3-line `engines` block added
- Full mobile unit suite: 500 tests passing (was 251 passing / 16 suites failing before `npm ci`, then 499 after Task 1, 500 after Task 2)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Real-SQL default mock, single moduleNameMapper, .test.tsx collection, Node engines floor** - `a9e2fc0` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Rewrite storage.test.ts to assert on table state and prove broken SQL fails** - `6113fdc` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `mobile/test/expo-sqlite.mock.ts` - Delegates `openDatabaseAsync` to `createNodeSqliteDb()`; real SQL by default
- `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` - Single `moduleNameMapper` block; `testMatch` includes `.test.tsx`
- `mobile/src/hooks/render-hook-wrapper.test.tsx` - New: proves `.tsx` collection and JSX transform via `renderHook`'s `wrapper` option
- `mobile/src/storage.test.ts` - Rewritten to assert on real table state instead of SQL-string fragments
- `package.json` - Added `engines.node >=22.5.0`
- `package-lock.json` - Synced (engines block only, 3 lines)

## Decisions Made

- Global mock delegates to `createNodeSqliteDb()` per call rather than sharing one instance across calls, matching the existing `getDb()` caching contract (one real DB per test file registry) — consistent with D-05
- `hasPendingSyncWork` tests replaced the original SQL-string-content assertion with two new behavior tests (future vs. past `next_retry_at` on failed items), preserving full behavioral coverage without depending on SQL string content
- `discardSurveyLocalChanges` "removed_queue" test seeds exactly one pending queue row and asserts `removed_queue === 1` (previously asserted `>= 0`, which was not a meaningful assertion against a real DB)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written. `node_modules` was missing in the fresh worktree; per the parallel-execution setup instructions this was resolved with `npm ci --ignore-scripts` before running any tests (not a plan deviation — anticipated harness step).

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the expected `npm ci` step to populate `node_modules` in the fresh worktree.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Real-SQL default and `.test.tsx` collection are in place for plans 02–07 in this phase and for Phases 01.4/01.5, which depend on storage tests that fail on broken SQL
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts` required no changes (`git diff --quiet` passes), honoring D-06
- No blockers for the next plan in this wave
