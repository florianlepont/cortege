# Phase 01.3 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | Jest 29 + ts-jest (api, mobile); GitHub Actions itself for workflow behaviour |
| **Config file** | `api/jest.unit.config.js`, `api/jest.config.js` (E2E), `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` |
| **Quick run command** | `npm --workspace api run test:unit` / `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` (whichever workspace the task touched); `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml` for workflow-only tasks |
| **Full suite command** | `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test:unit && npm run format:check` (E2E runs in CI — no Postgres/Docker in the agent sandbox) |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~90 seconds locally |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run the quick command for the touched workspace, or actionlint for workflow files
- **After every plan wave:** Run the full suite command, then inspect the GitHub Actions run on the PR
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite green locally and the PR's CI run green, including `ci-ok`, E2E twice-in-a-row and the Docker build
- **Max feedback latency:** 120 seconds (local); CI round-trip for workflow behaviour

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 01.3-01-T1 | 01 | 1 | REQ-AUD-test-infra | T-01.3-01, T-01.3-02 | Real SQL is the default expo-sqlite mock; `.test.tsx` collected; lockfile diff limited to `engines` | unit + static | `cd mobile && npx jest --config jest.unit.config.js --listTests \| grep -c render-hook-wrapper.test.tsx && npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` | W0: `mobile/src/hooks/render-hook-wrapper.test.tsx` (new) | ✅ green |
| 01.3-01-T2 | 01 | 1 | REQ-AUD-test-infra | T-01.3-01 | storage.test.ts asserts table state; a broken INSERT fails it | unit | `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit -- storage.test.ts && npm --workspace mobile run test:unit && git diff --quiet mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts` (+ recorded `site_nam` sabotage run exits non-zero) | ✅ `mobile/src/storage.test.ts` (rewritten) | ✅ green |

| 01.3-02-T2 | 02 | 1 | REQ-AUD-test-infra | T-01.3-04 | Jest loads the E2E env (ibp_test) before specs; test:e2e no longer runs `npm run migrate` against the dev DB; README/CLAUDE.md document the separate database; current ci.yml E2E job uses ibp_test so intermediate pushes stay green | static (node) + CI | jest.config/package.json checks, `setup-e2e-env.js` yields ibp_test and throws for ibp, `jest --listTests`, ci.yml grep (no `POSTGRES_DB: ibp`, two `POSTGRES_DB: ibp_test`) (see plan) `&& npm --workspace api run test:unit` | W0: `api/test/setup-e2e-env.js` (new) | ✅ green |

| 01.3-04-T1 | 04 | 2 | REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline | T-01.3-14 | Thresholds floor-rounded from measured coverage | node self-check | `node -e` computeThresholds self-check (see plan) | W0: `scripts/coverage-by-directory.js` (new) | ✅ green |
| 01.3-04-T2 | 04 | 2 | REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline | T-01.3-13, T-01.3-14 | Per-directory ratchet enforced; forced 100% run fails | unit coverage | `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage && npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` | ✅ both unit configs | ✅ green |
| 01.3-05-T1 | 05 | 2 | all three | T-01.3-15…22 | SHA pins, least privilege, timeouts, PR cancellation, main-only push, CI OK aggregate | static | actionlint v1.7.12 on `ci.yml` + js-yaml structure check + grep assertions | ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (rewritten) | ✅ green |

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [x] actionlint available (binary download or action) and run on `.github/workflows/*.yml` — plan 05 (local `go install …/actionlint@v1.7.12`; checksum-verified tarball in the CI `check` job)
- [x] `api/test/global-setup.js` + `api/test/e2e-env.js` (E2E DB reset, `_test`-only guard) and `api/.env.test.example` — plan 02 Task 1; wired via `globalSetup` and `setup-e2e-env.js` — plan 02 Task 2
- [x] `coverageThreshold` blocks in `api/jest.unit.config.js` and `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` — plan 04 Task 2
- [x] Root `.dockerignore` — plan 02 Task 3
- [x] `.github/dependabot.yml` `github-actions` ecosystem entry — plan 05 Task 2
- [x] One `*.test.tsx` file proving collection — plan 01 Task 1
- [x] Storage test that fails on deliberately broken SQL (real `node:sqlite` mock) — plan 01 Task 2

## CI Evidence (plan 06, Task 2)

- PR: https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/pull/134 (head `cc86a04`)
- CI run: https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/35984369829
- CodeQL run: https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/35984369789

| Job | Conclusion |
|-----|------------|
| Detect changed paths | success |
| Lint, format, typecheck (incl. actionlint + shellcheck) | success |
| Unit tests — API (coverage thresholds) | success |
| Unit tests — Mobile (coverage thresholds) | success |
| E2E tests — API (run 1, sentinel, run 2 same DB, reset asserted) | success |
| Mobile build check (expo-doctor, expo export android) | success |
| Dependency audit (all deps, high+) | success |
| Docker image check (non-root, no mobile deps, healthcheck, /v1/health) | success |
| CI OK | success |
| CodeQL analysis | success |
| Build & push Docker image | skipped (PR, not a main push) |

Earlier run https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/35984140484 failed only on `Run actionlint`: shellcheck SC2034 (unused loop variable in the image health poll). The runner has shellcheck; the sandbox did not. Fixed in `cc86a04`.

## Post-merge Evidence (plan 07, Task 1)

- Main run for merge `4ac6b78`: https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36017011749 — every job success, CI OK success, Build & push success.
- Pushed tags: `ghcr.io/florianlepont/cortege:latest` and `ghcr.io/florianlepont/cortege:sha-4ac6b78c84c7ba07090fb0385325a20044e60a4d` (digest `sha256:a7a23490…4b625`).
- Proof PR https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/pull/135 (closed unmerged; run on the phase branch because the session may only push there, so no `ci-proof/*` branches were created):
  - docs-only commit `613deb6`, run https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36017112643 — Detect changed paths, Lint/format/typecheck, Dependency audit, CI OK = success; Unit API, Unit Mobile, E2E, Mobile build, Docker image check = skipped.
  - type-error commit `8f72bd7`, run https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36017507799 — Lint, format, typecheck = failure at the Typecheck step; Docker image check = failure (tsc in the image build); CI OK = failure.
  - Both proof commits removed from the branch afterwards.
- Branch protection on `main` requires only `CI OK` (the old job names had blocked PR #134 until the owner switched the rule).
- Plan 05 follow-up during the phase: expo-doctor's SDK-version check (live registry) made the job red on an unchanged PR after Expo 57.0.25 shipped; the 20 structural checks stay blocking and version drift is reported by an informational step (`83229c0`).

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Device build with new Metro/app.json (dev client, login, survey list, offline draft sync, map, camera/photo picker) | REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline | Needs a real device | Owner approved on device 2026-09-24 ✅ |
| Branch protection requires `CI OK` | REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline | Repo setting; agents must not change branch protection | Owner: Settings → Branches → rule for `main` → require status check `CI OK` | ✅ 2026-09-24 (owner; API shows required checks = ["CI OK"]) |
| VPS still pulls and runs the new image | REQ-AUD-reproducible-image | Needs the real VPS | After the first `main` push, owner checks the timer restarted the stack and `https://cortege.algernon.ovh/v1/health` answers | ✅ 2026-09-24 (health 200 checked by owner and agent; owner uploaded a survey photo from the app and it displayed, so the non-root container can still write attachments) |
| Deliberate type error / docs-only PR behaviour | REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline | Exercises GitHub Actions itself | Throwaway PRs: type error → `check` fails; `.md`-only change → expensive jobs skipped, `ci-ok` green | ✅ 2026-09-24, see Post-merge evidence |
