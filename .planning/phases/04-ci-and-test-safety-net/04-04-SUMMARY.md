# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01.3-01
    provides: Real-SQL default mock and rewritten storage.test.ts, which shift mobile coverage numbers this plan measures on
provides:
  - scripts/coverage-by-directory.js — reusable script that turns a Jest coverage-summary.json into floor-rounded per-directory + global coverage percentages
  - api/jest.unit.config.js and mobile/jest.unit.config.js with coverageThreshold blocks enforcing the ratchet
  - "`npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` and `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` — plan 05's CI unit jobs call these two scripts to get the coverage ratchet enforced; plan 05 must not redefine or duplicate coverage thresholds, only invoke these existing package scripts"

  - "mobile global threshold has no branches/functions keys because src/storage.ts is a pure re-export file with 0 branches and 0 functions in both totals; per Task 1's spec, metrics with a 0 total are omitted rather than given a threshold of 0"

# Phase 01.3 Plan 04: Coverage ratchet thresholds Summary

**Added scripts/coverage-by-directory.js and floor-rounded per-directory `coverageThreshold` blocks to both jest.unit.config.js files, measured fresh on the tree that includes plan 01's storage-test rewrite — proven to fail when a threshold is set above the measured value.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~25 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 3 (1 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `scripts/coverage-by-directory.js` (CommonJS, Node built-ins only) exports `computeThresholds(summary, workspaceDir)` — a pure function that groups every file in a coverage-summary.json by its first directory under `<workspaceDir>/src/` (files directly in `src/` or outside it entirely go to `"global"`), sums `covered`/`total` per metric, and emits `Math.floor(covered/total*100)`, omitting any metric whose group total is 0
- Verified the behavior spec with the plan's exact self-check (`node -e ...`) plus a manual re-run after fixing a path-resolution bug (see Deviations)
- Measured api and mobile unit coverage on the current tree (after plan 01's storage-test rewrite, not the research baselines) and pasted the script's printed JSON verbatim into each config's new `coverageThreshold` block, each preceded by a ratchet comment
- Both `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` and `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` pass with the thresholds in place
- Proved enforcement: `cd api && npx jest --runInBand --config jest.unit.config.js --coverage --coverageThreshold='{"global":{"lines":100}}'` exits 1 with `Jest: "global" coverage threshold for lines (100%) not met: 45.23%`
- `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` (repo-wide) both exit 0

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: coverage-by-directory script** - `244b9de` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Measure and set per-directory coverage thresholds (ratchet)** - `368fe4f` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/coverage-by-directory.js` - New: pure `computeThresholds(summary, workspaceDir)` plus a CLI (`node scripts/coverage-by-directory.js <workspace-dir>`) that reads `<workspace-dir>/coverage/unit/coverage-summary.json` and prints the JSON threshold object
- `api/jest.unit.config.js` - Added `coverageThreshold` with `global` (root src files) + 7 directory keys (`auth`, `common`, `database`, `debug`, `reports`, `surveys`, `users`)
- `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` - Added `coverageThreshold` with `global` (src/storage.ts) + 7 directory keys (`api`, `app`, `components`, `hooks`, `screens`, `storage`, `ui`)

## Measured Coverage Values

### api (measured 2026-09-24, `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`)

| Directory | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| global (root src files) | 66 | 62 | 20 | 63 |
| ./src/auth/ | 76 | 67 | 62 | 77 |
| ./src/common/ | 76 | 71 | 37 | 79 |
| ./src/database/ | 71 | 0 | 0 | 60 |
| ./src/debug/ | 71 | 47 | 38 | 72 |
| ./src/reports/ | 36 | 0 | 0 | 32 |
| ./src/surveys/ | 36 | 18 | 27 | 35 |
| ./src/users/ | 67 | 45 | 44 | 67 |

Overall api totals (informational, not a threshold key): Statements 45.97%, Branches 24.51%, Functions 32.06%, Lines 45.23%.

### mobile (measured 2026-09-24, `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`)

| Directory | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| global (src/storage.ts only) | 100 | — (0 total) | — (0 total) | 100 |
| ./src/api/ | 92 | 91 | 85 | 93 |
| ./src/app/ | 61 | 55 | 45 | 63 |
| ./src/components/ | 6 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| ./src/hooks/ | 82 | 65 | 80 | 83 |
| ./src/screens/ | 9 | 3 | 6 | 9 |
| ./src/storage/ | 56 | 35 | 68 | 58 |
| ./src/ui/ | 29 | 28 | 21 | 30 |

Overall mobile totals (informational, not a threshold key): Statements 51.44%, Branches 30.43%, Functions 41.41%, Lines 52.2%.

Both `api/jest.unit.config.js` and `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` config values were compared programmatically (`node -e`) against `computeThresholds()` re-run on the final coverage-summary.json for each workspace — every key/metric matches exactly, none above measured.

## Task 1 self-check (recorded per plan instruction)

Ran the plan's exact behavior-case verification against `computeThresholds`:
```
node -e "const {computeThresholds}=require('./scripts/coverage-by-directory.js');const m=(t,c)=>({total:t,covered:c,skipped:0,pct:0});const f=(t,c)=>({lines:m(t,c),statements:m(t,c),functions:m(0,0),branches:m(t,c)});const r=computeThresholds({total:f(1,1),'/w/src/a/x.ts':f(10,5),'/w/src/a/y.ts':f(10,10),'/w/src/main.ts':f(4,1)},'/w');if(r['./src/a/'].lines!==75||r.global.lines!==25||'functions' in r.global)process.exit(1)"
```
Exit code 0. `r` printed as `{"global":{"statements":25,"branches":25,"lines":25},"./src/a/":{"statements":75,"branches":75,"lines":75}}` — matches the spec (`./src/a/` = 75, global = 25, `functions` omitted from global since its total is 0).

## Decisions Made

- `computeThresholds` takes `workspaceDir` as a plain string prefix match (`workspaceDir + "/src/"`) rather than using `path.relative`, so the CLI must pass an already-resolved absolute `workspaceDir` to match the absolute paths Jest writes into `coverage-summary.json` — documented in the function and enforced in `main()` via `path.resolve(workspaceDir)`
- Kept `scripts/coverage-by-directory.js` outside both workspaces' `src/` trees and outside `npm run lint`'s scope (which only runs `eslint "src/**/*.ts"` per workspace) so the plan's explicit CommonJS `require()` requirement does not conflict with the repo's `no-require-imports` ESLint rule; verified `npm run lint` (repo-wide) does not touch `scripts/`
- Did not add `scripts/coverage-by-directory.js` to `format:check` scope investigation since that command only checks `**/*.{ts,tsx,json}`, and confirmed `npx prettier --check` on the file passes independently with the repo's double-quote/no-semicolon/trailing-comma style anyway

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed path-prefix mismatch between CLI and coverage-summary.json**
- **Found during:** Task 1, first live run of `node scripts/coverage-by-directory.js api`
- **Issue:** The CLI passed the raw `argv[2]` (relative path, e.g. `"api"`) as `workspaceDir` into `computeThresholds`, but `coverage-summary.json` keys are absolute paths (e.g. `/home/.../api/src/app.module.ts`). Every file failed the `startsWith(srcPrefix)` check and landed in `"global"`, producing a single flat `{"global": {...}}` result with no per-directory keys — silently wrong, would have masked all directory thresholds.
- **Fix:** `main()` now calls `computeThresholds(summary, path.resolve(workspaceDir))` so the prefix matches Jest's absolute paths. The pure function signature and self-check test (which already used matching absolute paths, `/w/...`) were unchanged.
- **Files modified:** scripts/coverage-by-directory.js
- **Verification:** `node scripts/coverage-by-directory.js api` now prints `"./src/auth/"`, `"./src/surveys/"`, etc. alongside `"global"`; acceptance criterion (`grep` for both keys) passes.
- **Committed in:** `244b9de` (Task 1 commit)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Corrected a copy-paste error in api's `global` threshold values before committing**
- **Found during:** Task 2, first `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` run with thresholds in place
- **Issue:** When transcribing the script's printed JSON into `api/jest.unit.config.js`, the `global.functions` value was mistakenly copied from the console's aggregate `Coverage summary` block (32%, the whole-api total) instead of the script's own `global` remainder value (20%, root src files only: `app.module.ts`, `app.controller.ts`, `app.setup.ts`, `main.ts`). Jest failed with `"global" coverage threshold for functions (32%) not met: 20%` — i.e. a threshold above measured, exactly the failure mode the ratchet must never allow (T-01.3-14).
- **Fix:** Replaced `global: { statements: 45, branches: 24, functions: 32, lines: 45 }` with the correct script output `global: { statements: 66, branches: 62, functions: 20, lines: 63 }` for api. Mobile's `global` value was independently re-verified against script output before commit and was already correct.
- **Files modified:** api/jest.unit.config.js
- **Verification:** Re-ran `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` (exits 0); re-ran the programmatic config-vs-script comparison for both workspaces (all keys match exactly).
- **Committed in:** `368fe4f` (Task 2 commit) — the corrected value is what was committed; the wrong value was fixed before staging and never committed separately.

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (2 Rule 1 bugs)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes were necessary for correctness of the ratchet itself — an uncaught version would have either silently disabled all per-directory thresholds (deviation 1) or shipped a threshold above measured value, which is the exact failure mode T-01.3-14 exists to prevent (deviation 2). No scope creep; both fixes stayed within Task 1/Task 2 file boundaries.

## Issues Encountered

- `node_modules` was missing in the fresh worktree; resolved with `npm ci --ignore-scripts` before running any tests, per the parallel-execution setup instructions (anticipated harness step, not a plan deviation, consistent with plan 01's summary).
- `mobile/App.tsx` does not appear as a key in `mobile/coverage/unit/coverage-summary.json` despite being listed in `collectCoverageFrom`; this is pre-existing Jest/coverage-collector behavior unrelated to this plan's changes (not investigated further — out of scope per plan 04's boundaries) and does not affect the `global` threshold since `mobile/src/storage.ts` is the only file that lands in mobile's `global` group.
- Mobile's coverage run prints `Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed` (an existing async-handle warning, unrelated to coverage thresholds); the process still exits 0 and both coverage runs completed successfully — not a plan 04 deviation.

## For Plan 05

Plan 05 owns `ci.yml` and was not touched by this plan. The exact package scripts plan 05's CI unit jobs should call to get the ratchet enforced are:
- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`
- `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`

Both already existed before this plan and already point at `jest.unit.config.js` (now carrying the `coverageThreshold` blocks) — plan 05 does not need to define or duplicate any threshold values, only invoke these two existing scripts.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Coverage ratchet is in place for both workspaces at today's measured floor; `scripts/coverage-by-directory.js` is reusable for future phases to raise (never lower) the thresholds by re-running it and pasting the new JSON in
- No blockers for plan 05 (parallel, owns ci.yml) or subsequent plans in this wave
