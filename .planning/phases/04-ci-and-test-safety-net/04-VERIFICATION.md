# Phase 01.3: CI and test safety net Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** A change that breaks types, the Docker image or the sync storage layer cannot reach `main` or production unnoticed.
**Verified:** 2026-09-24
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No, this is the initial verification

## Goal Achievement

Checked in both directions:
- **Types:** the `check` job runs `npm run typecheck` on every PR and main push, with no path filter. The type-error proof run 36017507799 failed at Typecheck, and CI OK failed with it.
- **Docker image:** `image-check` builds the image from the repo root on every PR that touches api, lockfile or dockerignore. It then smoke-tests uid, the healthcheck and `/v1/health`. Only CI OK gates the push, and the push happens only from main.
- **Sync storage layer:** the default expo-sqlite mock runs real SQL through `node:sqlite`. I broke an INSERT column name on purpose (`site_nam`) and `storage.test.ts` failed with "table local_surveys has no column named site_nam". I then restored the file.
- **Merge gate:** branch protection requires `CI OK` (owner confirmation in VALIDATION.md).

### Observable Truths (ROADMAP Success Criteria)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | CI runs typecheck; type-error PR fails; docs-only PR runs only cheap checks via path filters and one aggregating `ci-ok` check | VERIFIED | ci.yml `check` job has a Typecheck step. `changes` uses dorny/paths-filter with api/mobile/shared/image outputs. `unit-*`, `e2e`, `mobile-build` and `image-check` are gated on those outputs. `ci-ok` (`if: always()`) fails on any non-success, and counts only `skipped` as OK for filtered jobs. Proof runs 36017507799 (type error: check and CI OK failed) and 36017112643 (docs only: expensive jobs skipped, CI OK green) are recorded in VALIDATION.md. Branch protection requires only `CI OK` (owner). |
| 2 | Every job has timeout-minutes, least-privilege permissions, PR runs cancel superseded runs, actions pinned by SHA | VERIFIED | All 10 ci.yml jobs and the codeql job have `timeout-minutes`. The workflow level is `contents: read`. Only `changes` adds `pull-requests: read`, only `build` adds `packages: write`, and only CodeQL adds `security-events: write`. `cancel-in-progress` is set to `event_name == 'pull_request'`. A grep for `uses:` lines without a 40-hex SHA returns 0 matches. actionlint (checksum-verified) runs in CI. |
| 3 | API image built from repo root with `npm ci` on the root lockfile, non-root, tagged by SHA and `latest`, push only from main | VERIFIED | api/Dockerfile copies the root `package.json`/`package-lock.json` and runs `npm ci --workspace api` in both stages. It sets `USER node` and a `HEALTHCHECK` on /v1/health. Both build jobs use `context: .`, and the root `.dockerignore` excludes `.env`, `mobile` and `.git`. The `build` job runs only when `push && ref == refs/heads/main && image changed`, needs `ci-ok`, uses concurrency group `deploy-image` with no cancel, and pushes `:latest` and `:sha-${{ github.sha }}`. Main run 36017011749 pushed `sha-4ac6b78c…`. The owner confirmed the VPS is healthy on the non-root image. |
| 4 | Mobile tests run real SQL (in-memory SQLite behind expo-sqlite mock), hooks tested with renderHook, `*.test.tsx` collected, E2E DB reset before each run | VERIFIED | The `moduleNameMapper` in `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` maps `expo-sqlite` to `test/expo-sqlite.mock.ts`, which returns `createNodeSqliteDb()` (`node:sqlite` `:memory:`). The sabotage run failed as expected. `testMatch` includes `**/*.test.tsx`, and `--listTests` finds 1 tsx file. `renderHook` is used in 6 hook tests. `api/jest.config.js` sets `globalSetup: global-setup.js`, which drops and recreates the public schema, then calls `runMigrations(config)`. The guard matrix refuses `ibp`, an empty DB name, a remote host and NODE_ENV=production, and allows only `ibp_test`. The CI e2e job runs twice, with a sentinel check; the PR run is green. |
| 5 | Coverage runs in CI with per-directory thresholds at measured values (ratchet) | VERIFIED | The `unit-api` and `unit-mobile` jobs run `test:unit:coverage`. Both unit configs have per-directory `coverageThreshold` blocks with ratchet comments. Local coverage runs pass for api (98 tests) and mobile (500 tests). Raising `./src/surveys/` statements to 99 exits 1 ("threshold … not met: 36.26%"). |
| 6 | Mobile changes run expo-doctor and expo export; dependency audit fails on high; CodeQL scans JS/TS | VERIFIED | The `mobile-build` job runs pinned `expo-doctor@1.20.4` and `expo export --platform android`. `audit` runs `npm audit --audit-level=high` on every run; it exits 0 locally. `codeql.yml` covers `javascript-typescript` on PRs, main pushes and a weekly schedule; CodeQL run 35984369789 was green. |

**Score:** 6/6 roadmap truths verified. The plan-level truths (plans 01–07) were also checked: the single `moduleNameMapper`, `migrate.js` export plus the `require.main` guard, the VPS README rollback by `sha-` tag, the absence of `newArchEnabled` from app.json, and the removal of the Metro override. The GitHub-side truths come from the evidence in VALIDATION.md.

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | VERIFIED | 10 jobs; wired as described above |
| `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | VERIFIED | SHA-pinned codeql-action v4.38.1, build-mode none |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | VERIFIED | `github-actions` ecosystem with `open-pull-requests-limit: 5` |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| ci.yml `check` | `npm run typecheck` (mobile tsc + api build) | step | WIRED |
| ci.yml `ci-ok` | all 8 upstream jobs | `needs` + result checks | WIRED |

| `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` | `expo-sqlite.mock.ts` → `node:sqlite` | `moduleNameMapper` | WIRED |
| unit jobs | `coverageThreshold` | `test:unit:coverage` | WIRED |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks (run locally in this verification)

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Lint | `npm run lint` | exit 0 | PASS |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` | exit 0 | PASS |
| API unit + coverage thresholds | `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` | 10 suites / 98 tests, exit 0 | PASS |
| Mobile unit + coverage thresholds | `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` | 40 suites / 500 tests, exit 0 | PASS |
| Broken SQL fails storage test | Sabotage `site_name` → `site_nam` at `surveys.ts:43`, run `storage.test.ts`, restore | "no column named site_nam" failures; file restored, `git diff` clean | PASS |
| Ratchet enforced | api coverage with `./src/surveys/` statements 99 | exit 1, threshold not met | PASS |
| E2E reset guard | `assertResettableDatabase` matrix | ibp, {}, remote host and production refused; ibp_test allowed | PASS |
| `.test.tsx` collected | `jest --listTests` | 1 tsx file | PASS |
| Audit at high | `npm audit --audit-level=high` | exit 0 | PASS |
| Format check | `npm run format:check` | exit 1, only on 5 untracked, git-excluded `.claude/*` files (local GSD tooling, absent from the CI checkout; CI format check green) | PASS (local noise, not a regression) |

### Probe Execution

No `scripts/*/tests/probe-*.sh` is declared or present for this phase. Skipped.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plans | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------------|--------|----------|
| REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline | 03, 04, 05, 06, 07 | SATISFIED | SC1, SC2, SC5, SC6 |
| REQ-AUD-reproducible-image | 02, 05, 07 | SATISFIED | SC3; healthcheck present; `deploy-image` concurrency group |
| REQ-AUD-test-infra | 01, 02 | SATISFIED | SC4 |

No orphaned requirements. The REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes are still `[ ]`; the orchestrator should tick them when it closes the phase.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | mobile-build | `EXPO_DOCTOR_SKIP_DEPENDENCY_VERSION_CHECK=1`; SDK drift check is `continue-on-error` | Info | Documented deviation (`83229c0`): the 20 structural checks still block, and version drift is informational so an Expo patch release cannot turn unrelated PRs red |

There are no TBD, FIXME, XXX, TODO or HACK markers in the 25 non-planning files changed by the phase merge. The only match was a base64 substring in `package-lock.json`.

### Human Verification Required

None outstanding. The four manual checks (device build, branch protection requiring `CI OK`, VPS pull with health 200 and a photo upload on the non-root image, type-error and docs-only PR behaviour) were approved by the owner on 2026-09-24. They are recorded, with run URLs, in 04-VALIDATION.md.

### Gaps Summary

None. The phase goal holds in the codebase, and the GitHub-side evidence covers the parts that cannot be checked locally.
