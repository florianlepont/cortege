# Phase 01.3: CI and test safety net - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-09-24
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Owner decisions taken during `/gsd:plan-phase 1.3` after research (no discuss-phase run), plus the audit decisions recorded in `.planning/PROJECT.md` → Key Decisions

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Audit lots L5, L6 and the core of L7 (`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md`): CI gates typecheck, path-filters jobs behind one aggregating `ci-ok` check, runs coverage with ratchet thresholds, a dependency audit, a mobile build check and CodeQL; the API image is reproducible from the root lockfile, non-root, SHA-tagged and pushed only from `main`; mobile tests run real SQL and collect `*.test.tsx`; the E2E database is reset before each run. Phases 01.4 and 01.5 rely on this test infrastructure. The VPS pull-based deploy (`ghcr.io/florianlepont/cortege:latest`) must keep working unchanged.

## Implementation Decisions

### Dependency audit (REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline)
- D-01: `npm audit --audit-level=high` runs on **all** dependencies (dev included, no `--omit=dev`). It passes today (0 high/critical).

### Mobile build check (REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline)
- D-02: Fix the two current `expo-doctor` failures (`app.json` `newArchEnabled` schema violation, `metro.config.js` `disableHierarchicalLookup` mismatch) **before** wiring the `mobile-build` job, so it starts green. The monorepo reason behind the Metro override must be preserved or proven obsolete (`expo export` must still succeed). If the fix changes native configuration, flag it for an owner device check.

### CodeQL (REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline)
- D-03: CodeQL runs in a **separate** `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (PRs + weekly schedule), `javascript-typescript`, not part of `ci-ok`. The repo is public, so no Advanced Security licence is needed.

### Docker image (REQ-AUD-reproducible-image)
- D-04: Build from the repo root with `npm ci --workspace api` **without** `--include-workspace-root` (measured: 133 MB vs 529 MB; the root `dependencies` hold Expo/React Native). Non-root user, healthcheck on `/v1/health`, tags `latest` + commit SHA, push only from `main` pushes under a deploy concurrency group. Root `.dockerignore` added. `latest` stays the tag the VPS timer polls.

### Mobile test infrastructure (REQ-AUD-test-infra)
- D-05: Real SQL uses the existing `node:sqlite` helper (`mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts`, phase 1.2) as the default `expo-sqlite` mock — no `better-sqlite3`. Storage tests must fail on broken SQL.
- D-06: Criterion "hooks are tested with `renderHook`" is satisfied by the pattern phase 1.2 established; the 751-line spy-based `useSurveySync.test.ts` is **not** rewritten in this phase (only adapted if the mock change breaks it).
- D-07: `*.test.tsx` is collected by the mobile unit config.

### E2E (REQ-AUD-test-infra)
- D-08: A Jest `globalSetup` resets the E2E database (drop schema + run migrations) before each run; two consecutive runs against the same database must both pass.

### Coverage (REQ-AUD-ci-pipeline)
- D-09: `coverageThreshold` per directory at the values measured at execution time (ratchet, never lowered). Research baselines: API unit ≈46/25/32/45 %, mobile unit ≈51/31/41/52 % (stmt/branch/fn/line).

### Owner manual step
- D-10: After `ci-ok` has run green once on `main`, the owner configures branch protection on `main` with **`CI OK`** as the single required check (Settings → Branches). The plan ends with this as a human checkpoint; agents never change branch protection.

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact workflow layout and job names beyond `ci-ok`, actionlint placement, Dependabot `github-actions` entry, split of plans and waves (plans touching `ci.yml` must be sequenced).

## Deferred Ideas

- Moving root `expo`/`react`/`react-native` dependencies into `mobile/package.json` → Phase 1.9 (hygiene).
- Rewriting `useSurveySync.test.ts` to `renderHook` → later test-completeness work (Phase 1.8).
