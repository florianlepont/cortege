# Phase 01.7: API configuration, service split and database tuning - Research

**Researched:** 2026-09-25
**Domain:** NestJS 11 configuration (`@nestjs/config`), node-postgres pool tuning, service decomposition of a 1 896-line service, query-count reduction on the sync path, PostgreSQL 16 partial indexes / generated columns / advisory locks
**Confidence:** HIGH on the code facts (read at file:line, the key claims reproduced against PostgreSQL 16.13 and Node 22.22 in scratch databases). MEDIUM on the query-budget design and the IGN tile cache sizing. The design is proven in SQL, but the TypeScript rewrite is not written yet.

## Summary

The phase has three parts that are largely independent, and each one hides a surprise the planner must know about.

**Configuration (REQ-AUD-config).**
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` is **not dead**. The HS256 test path in `auth.guard.ts:78-91` and `POST /v1/debug/test-token` (`debug.controller.ts:17-19`) both read it, and every E2E spec gets its bearer token that way. Only `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` and `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` are truly unread.
- "ACCESS_TOKEN_* are gone" therefore needs a replacement. We recommend a per-process random HS256 secret that exists only when `NODE_ENV=test`, so no env var is left at all.
- The current `@nestjs/config` release, 12.0.1, is **ESM-only** (`"type": "module"`, no `require` export). The API compiles to CommonJS and runs under Jest 29 / ts-jest, so the phase must pin **`@nestjs/config@4.0.4`**. That version supports Nest 11, and in it `validate` runs synchronously inside `forRoot`.
- **The VPS today runs with `CORS_ORIGIN=` (empty)**, per `infra/vps/env.example`. Deployment is pull-based: `update-stack.sh` pulls the new image and restarts. So any new fail-fast rule becomes a production outage unless `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env` is fixed *before* the image lands. The phase needs a config pre-flight check and an owner action on the VPS.

**Service split and query efficiency (REQ-AUD-surveys-split).** `SurveysService` is 1 896 lines, not the audit's 1 570: phases 01.4 and 01.6 grew it.
- **Duplicates:**
  - `getSurveyForUser` exists twice, with `SELECT *`: `surveys.service.ts:1596-1613` and `surveys-attachments.service.ts:38-54`.
  - `insertEvent` exists twice, plus an inline third copy in `reports.service.ts:57-61` that writes `actor_id = NULL`.
- **Measured query baseline** for one `POST /v1/sync` of 100 upserts, counted by spying on `pg.Client.prototype.query`:
  - 100 creates with 1 parcel each: **1 001** queries.
  - 100 creates with 3 parcels each: **1 301**.
  - 100 updates with 1 parcel: **901**.
  - 100 updates with 3 parcels: **1 101**.
- **Reaching ≥3x fewer requires more than batching the parcel inserts.** Each operation spends 2 statements on `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` alone, so with a per-operation explicit transaction the floor for updates is about 4 statements per op (≈2.25x).
- The recommended design, proven in SQL on PG16:
  - A create becomes one atomic writable-CTE statement: parcels, survey, links and event.
  - An update becomes an unlocked read plus one CAS-guarded CTE, using `xmin` as the token.
  - Both fall back to today's locked-transaction path on conflict.
  - Result: ≈101 statements for 100 creates (≈10x) and ≈201 for 100 updates (≈4.5x).
- **Cursor pagination can be backward compatible for free.** The mobile app never calls `GET /surveys` or `GET /reports`, and calls `GET /surveys/:id/events` without parameters (`mobile/src/api/ibp-api.ts:135-146`).
- **The IGN WFS fetch and `CadastreProviderService.fetchJson` both clear their timeout before the body is read.** A stalled body hangs forever (reproduced on Node 22); `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` fixes it.

**Database (REQ-AUD-db-tuning).**
- **`auth_sessions` is already dropped.** Migration 011 (`011_auth0_migration.sql:21`) drops it, and a freshly migrated database and the local `ibp` database both confirm it is absent. The criterion reduces to an idempotent safety `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` and a test.
- The generated centroid columns are feasible on PG16. But an unguarded `(centroid->>'lat')::double precision` **fails the migration on any non-numeric row**, so the expression must be guarded with a nested `CASE`, reproduced below.
- The partial index alone does **not** remove the sequential scans on the public routes. The two public queries also need rewriting:
  - map items: limit first, then a lateral per-survey aggregate;
  - parcel statuses: a lateral "latest public survey per parcel" instead of a window over all public surveys.
  - With 10 000 seeded surveys: map items 23.6 ms → 5.0 ms, and bbox parcel status becomes a pure index plan (1.6 ms).
- **Concurrent migration runs race today.** Two concurrent `runMigrations()` calls on an empty database: one fails with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_type_typname_nsp_index"`.

**Primary recommendation:** Build the phase in three waves:
1. **Wave 1 (two parallel plans):**
   - Config: `@nestjs/config@4.0.4` plus a class-validator `validate` function with explicit production rules, the pool, the Logger, CORS and a pre-flight script.
   - Migration 015 and the advisory lock.
2. **Wave 2:** Extract `SurveyEventsService` and `SurveysRepository`, then `ParcelsService` (merging the IGN client, with `AbortSignal.timeout` and a tile cache), then `PublicMapService`.
3. **Wave 3:** Pagination, then the upsert statement folding, checked by a committed query-budget E2E spec. The upsert folding is the riskiest step and goes last.

## Architectural Responsibility Map

| Capability | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Env validation, fail-fast, typed config | API / Backend (bootstrap) | Infra (VPS env file, compose) | Only the API knows its rules. The VPS file must satisfy them before deploy. |
| CORS policy | API / Backend | — | The mobile app is native and needs no CORS. Express applies it. |
| `pg` pool limits, statement timeouts | API / Backend | Database | Client-side pool options, sent as session GUCs at connect |
| Migration serialisation | Database (advisory lock) | Migration script | The lock lives in PostgreSQL. `scripts/migrate.js` takes it. |
| Survey CRUD / submit / sync writes | API / Backend | Database (single-statement atomicity) | The business rules stay in TS. Atomicity comes from one statement, or a transaction on the slow path. |
| Event log writes | API / Backend (`SurveyEventsService`) | Database | One writer for surveys, attachments and reports |
| Parcel registry and cadastre lookups | API / Backend (`ParcelsService` + `CadastreProviderService`) | External (IGN geocodage / API Carto / WFS) | One HTTP client with one timeout policy |
| Public map, parcel statuses | API / Backend (`PublicMapService`) | Database (partial index, generated columns) | Unauthenticated read path. Must be bounded and indexed. |
| IGN tile cache | API / Backend (in-process LRU) | — | Single instance on the VPS. No Redis in the stack. |
| List pagination | API / Backend | Mobile (passive: never paginates today) | Additive: `limit`/`cursor` are optional |

## User Constraints

No CONTEXT.md exists for this phase: `.planning/phases/08-api-config-service-split-and-db-tuning/` was empty before this research. The binding scope comes from ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md, quoted verbatim below. The planner must treat the success criteria as locked.

### Locked scope (ROADMAP.md, Phase 01.7 — verbatim)

**Goal**: The API fails fast on bad configuration, its survey logic is split into reviewable units, and its queries are bounded and indexed.

1. Configuration is read through `@nestjs/config` with a schema validated at startup; production refuses to start on default credentials or an empty `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`; `CORS_ORIGIN` is required in production; `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` and `ACCESS_TOKEN_*` are gone.
2. The `pg` pool has `max`, `idleTimeoutMillis`, `statement_timeout` and an `error` listener; services log through the Nest `Logger`, and a failed authentication logs only its message and code.
3. `SurveysService` is split into a repository, survey, events, parcels (merging the internal IGN client with `CadastreProviderService`) and public-map services; `getSurveyForUser` and `insertEvent` exist once.
4. Parcel ids are written in one batched statement, ownership checks select only the columns they need, list endpoints (`listForUser`, `getEvents`, `listReports`) paginate by cursor while still answering unpaginated callers, and the IGN fetch caches per tile and times out on the body as well as the headers. A 100-operation sync batch issues at least three times fewer queries than today.
5. The public-surveys partial index and generated `centroid_lat`/`centroid_lng` columns with a btree index exist (no PostGIS), migrations take a `pg_advisory_lock`, and the dead `auth_sessions` tables are dropped — `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on 10 000 surveys attached to the PR.

### Requirement definitions (REQUIREMENTS.md:130-132, verbatim)

- **REQ-AUD-config** — Validated configuration schema, bounded `pg` pool with an error listener, strict CORS in production, Nest `Logger` everywhere, dead token secrets removed. *(Audit A-M8. Lot L14)*
- **REQ-AUD-surveys-split** — `SurveysService` split into repository, survey, events, parcels and public-map services; batched parcel writes; column-scoped ownership checks; cursor pagination; cached, fully timed-out IGN fetch. *(Audit ARCH-2 and API efficiency findings. Lot L15)*
- **REQ-AUD-db-tuning** — Public-surveys partial index, generated centroid columns with a btree index (no PostGIS), migration advisory lock, dead `auth_sessions` tables dropped. *(Audit efficiency findings, ARCH-7. Remainder of lot L16)*

### Carried-in items (STATE.md pending todos)

- **In scope:** the malformed legacy sync cursor returns 500. `parseSyncChangesCursor` (`surveys-normalize.utils.ts:446-476`) accepts `2024-02-30T00:00:00Z|x` and `2024-01-01 12:00:00 junk|x`. The `$2::timestamptz` cast at `surveys-sync.service.ts:292` then raises 22008 or 22007, and nothing maps it to 400. Both errors were reproduced on PG 16.13.
- **Recommended in scope, needs owner OK:** move both compose files to the pinned `pgsty/minio` image. It is infra, not API config. But this phase already edits both compose/env files and needs one owner visit to the VPS anyway (see Open Questions).

### Audit-plan items in L14–L16 that the ROADMAP criteria do not name

The planner should still include these. They belong to the same lots, and each one is small.
- The `survey_events(actor_id)` index. `users.service.ts:285-287` runs `UPDATE survey_events ... WHERE actor_id = $1` on account deletion, and today that is a sequential scan.
- Drop the redundant indexes `idx_users_auth0_sub`, `idx_surveys_parcel_id` and `idx_survey_parcels_survey_id`. All three are verified redundant (see Pattern 6).
- The IGN "studied parcels" query, restricted to the fetched area (`surveys.service.ts:1369-1400` is unbounded today).
- The `fetchUserInfo` call to Auth0 `/userinfo` (`auth.guard.ts:217`) has no timeout. It is the same class of defect as the IGN fetch.

### Dependency and non-scope

- Depends on Phase 01.6, which is complete and verified 6/6. The work relies on:
  - `StorageService` (`api/src/storage/storage.service.ts`);
  - the `(xid8, seq)` feed;
  - the same-version content rule (D-04/D-16);
  - `DatabaseService.transaction` (01.4 D-06).
- Out of scope, owned by later phases:
  - the `packages/ibp-domain` extraction (01.8);
  - the RS256 path tests against a local JWKS (01.8);
  - splitting `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` (01.8);
  - the `CLAUDE.md` and docs sweep, and unused dependencies such as `bcryptjs`, `@nestjs/schedule` and the unregistered `EmailService` (01.9).
  - Exception: this phase must still update the env-var rows it invalidates.

</phase_requirements>

## Project Constraints (from CLAUDE.md)

- npm workspaces monorepo. The API is NestJS 11 on Node 20+ (Node 22 in the Docker image and CI), TypeScript 5.9 strict.
- **Raw SQL via `pg`, no ORM.** Migrations are ordered SQL files in `api/migrations/`, run by `api/scripts/migrate.js`.
- Formatting: double quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas, 2-space indent, 100-char lines (Prettier 3.8).
- ESLint:
  - unused vars are errors (prefix `_`);
  - `no-explicit-any` is a warning;
  - `no-require-imports` is an error in `src/`.
- Naming:
  - DTOs end in `Dto`/`Body`;
  - utilities and services are camelCase files;
  - unit tests are `api/test/*.spec.ts` (existing convention);
  - E2E tests are `api/test/*.e2e-spec.ts`.
- Prefer `export type` for type-only exports. **API DTOs use `class-validator`.**
- E2E tests target a `*_test` database only; `globalSetup` drops and re-migrates it.
- Before committing: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run format:check`.
- CI: lint, format, typecheck, unit, E2E (local-mode and MinIO-mode jobs), Docker image build and smoke. Deployment is pull-based: a VPS systemd timer every 5 min, runtime secrets in `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env`.
- No force-push to `main`; feature work goes through a PR.
- STATE decision, 2026-09-25: owner device checks are delegated. Each phase gate replays the owner steps against the built API with a committed simulation script (MinIO mode through `pgsty/minio`, plus the debug test-token). **The test-token path must keep working after the secret change.**

## Standard Stack

### Core

| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `@nestjs/config` | **4.0.4** (pin; not 12.x) | `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validate, isGlobal, ignoreEnvFile, cache })`, `ConfigService` | Official NestJS package, required by the criterion. 4.0.4 has peer `@nestjs/common ^10 \|\| ^11` and is CommonJS [VERIFIED: npm registry `npm view @nestjs/config@4.0.4`; inspected `dist/config.module.js` of the 4.0.4 tarball]. 12.0.1 is `"type": "module"` with only an `import` export [VERIFIED: npm registry], which the CommonJS build (`api/tsconfig.json` `"module": "commonjs"`) and Jest 29 cannot `require`. |
| `class-validator` / `class-transformer` | 0.15.1 / 0.5.1 (installed) | The env schema class plus `validateSync`, via a custom `validate` function | Already the project's DTO convention. The official docs show exactly this pattern [CITED: docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration]. No new dependency. |
| `pg` | 8.20.0 (installed) | Pool options `max`, `idleTimeoutMillis`, `connectionTimeoutMillis`, plus client options `statement_timeout`, `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, `application_name` | [CITED: node-postgres.com/apis/pool and /apis/client] "All valid client config options are also valid here." |
| Node global `AbortSignal.timeout()` | Node 22 (built in) | A timeout that covers headers **and** body for `fetch` | Reproduced: it rejects a stalled body after about 300 ms, while the current clear-after-headers pattern hangs (see Pitfall 7) |

### Supporting

| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `lru-cache` | ^11 (11.5.3 current; 11.3.1 already in the tree via `jwks-rsa → lru-memoizer`) | Bounded IGN tile cache: `max` + `maxSize`/`sizeCalculation` + `ttl` | Recommended over a hand-rolled Map, because memory must be bounded by size, not only by entry count (768 MB container). Dual CJS/ESM exports [VERIFIED: npm registry `exports`]. Must become a **direct** `api` dependency; do not rely on hoisting. |

### Alternatives Considered

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| class-validator `validate` | Joi `validationSchema` | New dependency. Current Nest docs steer new projects away from Joi [CITED: docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration]. |
| class-validator `validate` | zod | Not an API dependency today: `zod@3.25.76` exists only through the mobile workspace (`jimp`). It is Standard-Schema native only in `@nestjs/config` 12, which we cannot use. It would still need a custom `validate`, so it has no advantage here. |
| `@nestjs/config@4.0.4` | Upgrade to NestJS 12 + config 12 | NestJS 12 is out (`@nestjs/common` 12.1.0 [VERIFIED: npm registry]), but it is a framework major upgrade. Out of scope; flag for a later hygiene phase. |
| `lru-cache` | A hand-written Map LRU with TTL | About 40 lines, but no size-based bound and more edge cases (see Don't Hand-Roll) |
| Single-statement writes for the query budget | Keep per-op `BEGIN…COMMIT` and only batch parcels | Measured floor ≈4 statements per update op, ≈2.25x. It fails criterion 4 for update-heavy batches. |

**Installation (api workspace only):**
```bash
npm install --workspace api @nestjs/config@4.0.4 lru-cache@^11
```

**Version verification (2026-09-25):**
```
npm view @nestjs/config versions  → … 4.0.4 (2026-04-09), 12.0.0 (2026-08-27), 12.0.1 (2026-09-22)
npm view @nestjs/config@12.0.1    → "type": "module", exports only "import"/"default"
npm view @nestjs/config@4.0.4     → peer @nestjs/common ^10 || ^11; deps dotenv 17.4.1, lodash, dotenv-expand 12; no postinstall
npm view lru-cache version        → 11.5.3; repository github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache
installed: @nestjs/common 11.1.21, class-validator 0.15.1, pg 8.20.0, node v22.22.2
```

## Package Legitimacy Audit

| Package | Registry | Age | Downloads | Source Repo | slopcheck | Disposition |
|---------|----------|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `@nestjs/config` | npm | 4.0.4 published 2026-04-09; package line since 2019 | very high (official NestJS) [ASSUMED] | github.com/nestjs/config (maintainers kamilmysliwiec, nestjscore) | not determinable [ASSUMED] | Approved pending checkpoint. No postinstall script [VERIFIED: npm view scripts]. |
| `lru-cache` | npm | multi-year; 11.5.3 modified 2026-09-18 | very high [ASSUMED] | github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache | not determinable [ASSUMED] | Approved pending checkpoint. Already in the dependency tree at 11.3.1. |

**Packages removed due to slopcheck [SLOP] verdict:** none
**Packages flagged as suspicious [SUS]:** none

*slopcheck (installed this session) has no check-only mode. `slopcheck install <pkgs>` ran a real `npm install` at the repo root and added both packages to the root `package.json`/lockfile. Those two files were restored from `HEAD` and `node_modules` was reconciled (`git status` clean). Its verdict output was not captured, so both packages are tagged `[ASSUMED]`, and the planner must add a `checkpoint:human-verify` before the install task. **Planner note:** never run `slopcheck install` in this repo. It mutates the root manifest.*

### Recommended Project Structure

Keep everything that moves out of `SurveysService` **under `api/src/surveys/`**. The per-directory coverage thresholds in `api/jest.unit.config.js:15-25` are keyed on directories, and a new top-level `src/parcels/` would silently escape them.

### Pattern 1: Validated configuration with explicit production rules

**What:**
- `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true, ignoreEnvFile: true, cache: true, validate: validateEnv })`.
- `validateEnv` does three things:
  - (a) coerces and validates types with class-validator (`plainToInstance(..., { enableImplicitConversion: true })` + `validateSync`);
  - (b) applies `assertProductionSafety` when `NODE_ENV === "production"`;
  - (c) returns the validated object.

**Why `ignoreEnvFile: true`:** `main.ts:2` already runs `import "dotenv/config"`, and the E2E loader (`test/e2e-env.js`) controls precedence carefully. A second loader in ConfigModule reads `cwd/.env` by default. It would never override existing keys (`assignVariablesToProcess` skips keys already in `process.env`), but it is one more source to reason about.

**Verified 4.0.4 behaviour** [VERIFIED: tarball `dist/config.module.js:73-99`]:
- `static async forRoot(options)`.
- `validate(config)` runs synchronously inside it, on `{...envFile, ...process.env}`.
- The validated values are written back to `process.env` **only for keys not already present**.
- A thrown error rejects the `forRoot` promise, so `NestFactory.create` rejects, and `main.ts:20-23` then logs and runs `process.exit(1)`.

**Production rules** (the minimal set that satisfies criterion 1 without breaking the VPS; see Runtime State Inventory):

| Variable | Rule in production | Today's silent default (file:line) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `POSTGRES_HOST/PORT/USER/DB` | required, non-empty | `localhost/5432/ibp/ibp` (`database.service.ts:17-21`) |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | required; not `ibp`, not `CHANGE_ME*` | `ibp` (`database.service.ts:20`) |
| `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE` | required, `local\|minio` | `local` (`storage.service.ts:47`) |
| `OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` (minio mode) | required; not `minio123`, not `CHANGE_ME*` | `minio123` (`storage.service.ts:57`) |
| `OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` (minio mode) | required | `http://localhost:9000` (`storage.service.ts:54`) |
| `OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` | required, but `minio` is **allowed**: the VPS compose defaults it (`${MINIO_ACCESS_KEY:-minio}`), and the MinIO root *user name* is not the secret | `minio` (`storage.service.ts:56`) |
| `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` | required, non-empty | `""` (`auth.guard.ts:14,16`) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | required: a comma-separated list of `https://` origins, **or** the explicit keyword `none` | `""`, which today means `origin: true` (`app.setup.ts:24-29`) |
| `AUTH0_MGMT_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` | **warn** at startup if empty or `CHANGE_ME` (account deletion breaks), do not fail | `""` (`auth0-management.service.ts:15-16`) |

Outside production everything keeps today's defaults. E2E, CI and local dev need no new variable.

**Import-time readers.** Several readers evaluate at import time:
- `auth.guard.ts:14-20` (module-level consts);
- `app.module.ts` `isDebugSurfaceEnabled()` and `buildThrottlerOptions()` inside the `@Module` decorator.

Make the guard read the injected `ConfigService` in its constructor. For the decorator-time readers, keep calling the pure helpers with `process.env`, but route them through the same `validateEnv`/`loadAppConfig` function so there is one source of truth. `debug-gating.ts:1-17` documents why the debug gate must stay `NODE_ENV !== "production"`.

**Enforcement:** add an ESLint `no-restricted-properties` rule (`object: "process", property: "env"`) for `api/src/**` with an override for `api/src/config/**` and `api/src/main.ts`. That makes "read through `@nestjs/config`" mechanically checkable.

### Pattern 2: Bounded `pg` pool with an error listener

**What:** configure the pool from config, with production-safe defaults, all overridable by env (`PG_POOL_MAX`, …):

| Option | Recommended default | Why |
|--------|--------------------|-----|
| `max` | 10 | Same as the pg default, now explicit. VPS Postgres `max_connections` is 100 (image default), with a 768 MB container. |
| `idleTimeoutMillis` | 30 000 | Pg default is 10 000; either is fine, make it explicit |
| `connectionTimeoutMillis` | 5 000 | **The pg default is 0, which waits forever** [CITED: node-postgres.com/apis/pool]. Pool exhaustion then hangs requests instead of failing. |
| `statement_timeout` | 10 000 ms | The largest measured statement is well under 50 ms at 10k rows. The mobile client timeout is 15 s. A timeout raises SQLSTATE 57014, which `mapSyncError` classifies as retryable (not class 22/23), which is correct. |
| `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` | 60 000 ms | Kills leaked transactions. Keep it generous: E2E specs in `sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts` deliberately hold a transaction open. |
| `application_name` | `cortege-api` | Makes the API visible in `pg_stat_activity` |

- `this.pool.on("error", (err) => this.logger.error(\`idle client error: ${err.message}\`, (err as {code?:string}).code))`. Without a listener, "node will emit an uncaught error and potentially crash your node process" [CITED: node-postgres.com/apis/pool].
- `migrate.js` uses its own `Client`, so it is unaffected by these options.

### Pattern 3: Service split: boundary and extraction order

**Current `SurveysService` responsibilities** (`surveys.service.ts`, 1 896 lines):

| Lines | Responsibility | Target |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| 54-71 | constructor: IGN WFS env reads | → config + `CadastreProviderService` |
| 73-141 | `listForUser` (no LIMIT) | `SurveysService.list` + `SurveysRepository.listForUser` (keyset) |
| 143-514 | `upsertForUser` (3 copies of the "re-read → same-version → classify" block at 342-383 and 453-485, plus the conflict path at 280-293) | `SurveysService.upsert`; dedupe the re-read block into one private helper; SQL → repository |
| 516-564 | `resolveSelectedParcelIds`, `resolveVersionInfo` | `SurveysService` (logic) + `ParcelsService.ensureParcelIds` |
| 566-809 | `patchSurvey`, `patchSurveyVisibility`, `applyVisibilityChange`, `resolveSameVersionUpsert` | `SurveysService` |
| 811-864 | `getSurveyById` (uses `computeSurveyDisplayLocation`) | `SurveysService` + `ParcelsService.displayLocation` |
| 866-1029 | `submitSurvey` (sorted `FOR UPDATE` on parcels, 01.4 D-08) | `SurveysService`: **do not change the lock order** |
| 1031-1109 | `deleteSurvey` (storage cleanup after commit, 01.4 D-07) | `SurveysService` |
| 1111-1123 | `getEvents` (no LIMIT) | `SurveyEventsService.listForSurvey` |
| 1125-1194 | `getPublicMapItems` | `PublicMapService` |
| 1196-1310 | `getPublicParcelStatuses` (JSON-cast bbox, window over all public surveys) | `PublicMapService` |
| 1312-1484 | **second IGN WFS client** (timeout cleared at 1346, unbounded body 1352, unbounded "studied" query 1369-1400, silent `catch {}` 1481) | `CadastreProviderService.fetchParcelFeatures(tile)` + `PublicMapService` |
| 1486-1581 | `resolveParcelByCoordinates`, `getParcelSurveyHistory` | `ParcelsService` |
| 1583-1627 | `getSurveyForUserOrThrow` / `getSurveyForUser` (`SELECT *`) / `insertEvent` | `SurveysRepository.findOwned` / `SurveyEventsService.insert` |
| 1629-1656 | `getSurveyParcelIds`, `syncSurveyParcels` (DELETE all + INSERT) | repository (diff-based, see Pattern 4) |
| 1658-1695 | `computeSurveyDisplayLocation` (2 queries) | `ParcelsService` (1 query using the generated columns) |
| 1697-1813 | `ensureParcelIds` (**loop**: SELECT + INSERT per parcel), `resolveParcelFromCoordinates`, `ensureParcelById` | `ParcelsService` (one `INSERT … SELECT unnest(...) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) |
| 1815-1896 | `getDefaultVersionNumber`, `validateParcelSubmit` (**loop** of version queries per parcel, 1877-1887) | repository (one `GROUP BY parcel_id` query) + `SurveysService` |

**Duplicates to collapse:**
- `getSurveyForUser` and `getSurveyForUserOrThrow`: `surveys.service.ts:1583-1613` and `surveys-attachments.service.ts:25-54` (both `SELECT *`).
- `insertEvent`: `surveys.service.ts:1615-1627` and `surveys-attachments.service.ts:56-68`, plus the inline insert at `reports.service.ts:57-61`, which has **no `actor_id`** (01.2 A-M6 decision: reported events carry no reporter identity). The shared `insertEvent` must accept `actorId: string | null`.

**Column-scoped ownership check.** `findOwned(db, id, userId, { activeOnly, forUpdate, columns: "ownership" | "full" })`:
- `"ownership"` = `id, user_id, status, visibility, sync_version, deleted_at`.
- Callers that need **only** ownership:
  - all 7 calls in `surveys-attachments.service.ts` (122, 175, 264, 326, 398, 419, plus the create lock);
  - `getEvents`;
  - `patchSurveyVisibility` (uses `visibility`);
  - `deleteSurvey` (existence).
- `"full"` stays for `upsert` (content comparison D-04/D-16), `patch`, `submit` and `getById`.

**Module wiring.** `SurveyEventsService` is needed by `ReportsModule`. Put it and `SurveysRepository` in a small exported `SurveysDataModule`, imported by `SurveysModule` and `ReportsModule`. There is no cycle: `SurveysModule` does not import `ReportsModule`.

**Controllers keep routes and response shapes.**
- `PublicController` injects `PublicMapService`.
- `ParcelsController` injects `ParcelsService`.
- `SurveysController.events` delegates to `SurveyEventsService`.
- The E2E suites are black-box over HTTP: only `DatabaseService` and `StorageService` are fetched from the module (`grep moduleFixture.get`). They are the safety net.

**Extraction order (lowest to highest risk):**
1. `SurveyEventsService`. Touches 3 services mechanically.
2. `SurveysRepository.findOwned` (column-scoped). It replaces both `getSurveyForUser` copies.
3. `ParcelsService` + the IGN merge into `CadastreProviderService` (timeout fix, tile cache, commune-scoped "studied" query).
4. `PublicMapService`, with the rewritten queries. **Depends on migration 015** (generated columns).
5. Cursor pagination on the three lists.
6. Upsert statement folding (the query budget). **Highest risk:** it touches the 01.4 and 01.6 invariants, so it goes last, with the query-budget spec written first (Wave 0).

**Risk hotspots:**
- `upsertForUser`. Invariants to preserve:
  - `sync_version` guards;
  - same-version content rule (D-04/D-16);
  - submitted read-only (D-04/D-13);
  - `survey_id_conflict` on a foreign id (T-01.4-15);
  - event written in the same transaction (the `xid8` feed depends on it).
- `submitSurvey`: sorted `FOR UPDATE` on parcels (01.4 D-08) and the mapping of 23505 to 409.
- `deleteSurvey`: the object delete runs *after* commit.
- The fault-injection trigger (`test/e2e-fault-injection.ts`) relies on the event insert failing the same unit of work. A single CTE statement still satisfies that.

### Pattern 4: Query budget: from ~10 statements per op to 1-2

**Measured baseline** (this session). The instrument is `jest.spyOn(pg.Client.prototype, "query")` around one `POST /v1/sync`, against a freshly migrated `*_test` database, NODE_ENV=test. The count includes the 1 auth-guard lookup per request.

| Batch (100 `survey.upsert` ops) | Total | of which BEGIN/COMMIT | per op |
|---|---|---|---|
| creates, 1 parcel each | 1 001 | 200 | 10 |
| updates (v2), same 1 parcel | 901 | 200 | 9 |
| creates, 3 parcels each | 1 301 | 200 | 13 |
| updates (v2), 3 parcels | 1 101 | 200 | 11 |
| idempotent replays (same version) | 401 | 200 | 4 |

**Where the create statements go today** (1 parcel):
1. `BEGIN`
2. `SELECT * … FOR UPDATE`
3. parcel `SELECT`
4. parcel `INSERT`
5. next-version `SELECT`
6. survey `INSERT`
7. `DELETE survey_parcels`
8. `INSERT survey_parcels`
9. event `INSERT`
10. `COMMIT`

**Why batching parcels is not enough.** Keeping an explicit transaction per op costs 2 statements before any work. The best "fold everything" transactional update is `BEGIN`, lock-read, one CTE, `COMMIT` = 4 per op, which gives ≈401 for 100 updates: **2.25x, failing criterion 4**.

**Recommended design** (SQL verified on PG16 in a scratch DB):

1. **Create fast path: one statement per op, no `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`.** A single statement is atomic, so the 01.4 D-06 intent (the event is written in the same unit as the row) holds.
   - The writable CTE runs: `input_parcels` (unnest) → `ensured` (`INSERT INTO parcels … ON CONFLICT (parcel_id) DO NOTHING`) → `ins` (`INSERT INTO surveys … ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING RETURNING`), with the default `version_number` computed by a scalar subquery → `links` (`INSERT INTO survey_parcels SELECT … FROM ins`) → `ev` (`INSERT INTO survey_events … FROM ins`).
   - The FKs from `survey_parcels`/`survey_events` to `surveys` are satisfied inside the statement (verified).
   - If `ins` returns no row (the id exists), fall through to today's locked path. That covers the concurrent create race T-01.4-15 and a foreign id → `survey_id_conflict`.
2. **Update fast path: 2 statements per op.**
   - (a) An unlocked read of the full row, plus `array_agg(parcel_id)`, plus `xmin::text` as the CAS token.
   - (b) After the JS decisions (version compare, same-version classify, submitted read-only), one CTE: `ensured` parcels → `u` (`UPDATE surveys … WHERE id=$1 AND user_id=$2 AND xmin = $token::xid AND sync_version < $n RETURNING`) → `d` (`DELETE FROM survey_parcels … WHERE survey_id = u.id AND parcel_id <> ALL($ids)`) → `i` (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) → `ev`.
   - If `u` returns 0 rows, run today's locked re-read path, which already exists 3 times and becomes one helper.
   - **Why `xmin` and not `sync_version`:** `submitSurvey` (`surveys.service.ts:972-986`) and `applyVisibilityChange` (`:746-753`) change the row **without** bumping `sync_version`. A CAS on `sync_version` alone could overwrite a concurrent submit. An `xmin` CAS was verified: the stale token updates 0 rows.
3. **Same-version replays:** a single read (already about 2 statements after removing `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`).
4. Other op types (attachment create/delete, delete, visibility) keep their transactions. The budget is defined on upsert batches.

**Expected after:** 100 creates ≈ 1 + 100 = 101 (≈9.9x vs 1 001); 100 updates ≈ 1 + 200 = 201 (≈4.5x vs 901, ≈5.5x vs 1 101).

**This changes how 01.4 D-06 is realised on the upsert fast path.** The explicit transaction becomes single-statement atomicity. The invariant is unchanged: row, links and event commit together or not at all. Record it as a new decision in CONTEXT.md.

### Pattern 5: Backward-compatible keyset pagination

**Consumers verified:**
- Mobile calls only `GET /surveys/:id/events` without query params (`mobile/src/api/ibp-api.ts:135-146`, `useSurveySync.ts:401-412`).
- It never calls `GET /surveys` or `GET /reports`.
- `GET /surveys` already answers `{ items, next_cursor: null }` (`surveys.controller.ts:51`, `api-contract-v1.md:308-329`).

**Rules:**
- **No `limit` → identical to today.** All rows, same order (add a deterministic tiebreaker only: `id` / `seq`), `next_cursor: null`.
- `limit` given (1..100) → `limit + 1` fetch, keyset on the sort key, `next_cursor` opaque.

| Endpoint | Order today | Keyset | Cursor |
|----------|------------|--------|--------|
| `GET /surveys` | `updated_at DESC` (`surveys.service.ts:136`) | `(updated_at, id) < ($ts, $id)` | opaque `v1:` + base64url(JSON `{t, i}`) |
| `GET /surveys/:id/events` | `created_at DESC` (`:1118`) | `(created_at, seq) < ($ts, $seq)` | same form; `seq` is a bigint string |
| `GET /reports` | `created_at DESC, id DESC` (`reports.service.ts:96`) | `(created_at, id) < ($ts, $id)` | same form |

- **Cursor validation must be strict** (the 22007/22008 lesson). Decode, then require `t` to match `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}[ T]\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(\.\d{1,6})?(Z|[+-]\d{2}(:?\d{2})?)$`, then round-trip the date components (reject day 30 of February). Any failure → 400 `Invalid cursor`.
- Share this validator with the legacy sync cursor fix.
- Existing indexes cover all three keysets: `idx_surveys_user_updated (user_id, updated_at DESC)`, `idx_survey_events_survey (survey_id, created_at DESC)` and `idx_reports_status_created`.

### Pattern 6: Migration 015 (verified DDL, PG 16.13)

```sql
-- 015_public_indexes_centroid_columns.sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_surveys_public_submitted
  ON surveys (submitted_at DESC)
  WHERE status = 'submitted' AND visibility = 'public' AND deleted_at IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE parcels
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS centroid_lat double precision GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    CASE WHEN (centroid ->> 'lat') ~ '^\s*-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?\s*$'
      THEN CASE WHEN (centroid ->> 'lat')::double precision BETWEEN -90 AND 90
                THEN (centroid ->> 'lat')::double precision END
    END) STORED,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS centroid_lng double precision GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    CASE WHEN (centroid ->> 'lng') ~ '^\s*-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?\s*$'
      THEN CASE WHEN (centroid ->> 'lng')::double precision BETWEEN -180 AND 180
                THEN (centroid ->> 'lng')::double precision END
    END) STORED;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng ON parcels (centroid_lat, centroid_lng);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_survey_events_actor_id ON survey_events (actor_id) WHERE actor_id IS NOT NULL;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_auth0_sub;          -- duplicate of UNIQUE users_auth0_sub_key
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_surveys_parcel_id;        -- prefix of idx_surveys_parcel_year_version
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_survey_parcels_survey_id; -- prefix of survey_parcels_pkey (survey_id, parcel_id)

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS auth_sessions CASCADE;        -- already dropped by 011:21; idempotent safety
```

- **Verified behaviour of the guarded expression:**
  - `{"lat":"abc"}` → NULL (no error);
  - `{"lat":" 48.5 "}` → 48.5 (parity with `toFiniteNumber`, `surveys-normalize.utils.ts:281-290`, which accepts numeric strings);
  - `{"lat":95}` → NULL (parity with `normalizeCentroid`'s range check, `:300`);
  - `{}` → NULL;
  - `UPDATE … SET centroid` recomputes the columns.
- **The naive `(centroid->>'lat')::double precision` is accepted as immutable, but fails the whole `ALTER` on one bad row.**
- **Redundant-index proof:** after dropping `idx_survey_parcels_survey_id`, the planner used `Index Only Scan using survey_parcels_pkey` for `survey_id = …` (EXPLAIN in this session).

**EXPLAIN results** on 10 000 surveys (2 000 public submitted), 8 000 parcels, 19 997 links and 30 000 events, all seeded:

| Query | Before | After (index only) | After (index + rewrite) |
|-------|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| `/public/map-items` | Seq Scan surveys + Seq Scan survey_parcels, HashAggregate over 2 000, 23.6 ms | Index Scan idx_surveys_public_submitted, **still Seq Scan survey_parcels**, 18.9 ms | Limit-first Index Scan + LATERAL (Index Only Scan pkey), **no seq scan**, 5.0 ms |
| `/public/parcels/status?bbox` | Seq Scan parcels (JSON casts) + window over all public surveys | — | Bitmap Index Scan idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng + LATERAL latest (idx_survey_parcels_parcel_id), **no seq scan**, 1.6 ms |

### Pattern 7: One IGN HTTP client: full timeout, tile cache, bounded fan-out

- **Merge.** The WFS `GetFeature` code (`surveys.service.ts:1312-1484`) moves into `CadastreProviderService` next to geocodage/API Carto, sharing one `fetchJson(url)` that uses `fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(this.timeoutMs) })` and **awaits** `response.json()` inside the timed region.
- **Current bug, in both copies:**
  - `cadastre-provider.service.ts:196-198` does `return response.json()` inside `try`, with `clearTimeout` in `finally`: the timer is cleared before the body is read.
  - `surveys.service.ts:1346` does `.finally(() => clearTimeout(timeout))` on the `fetch` promise.
- **Tile cache.**
  - Snap the request bbox to XYZ tiles at a fixed zoom (recommend **z15**, about 1.2 km at 46°N; the mobile only asks at zoom ≥ 15, `surveys.service.ts:1206-1209`).
  - Fetch the missing tiles, with concurrency ≤ 4 and one WFS call per tile (`count` 1200, as today).
  - Cache the **parsed feature list** per `z/x/y` in `lru-cache` with `ttl: 24h`, `max` ≈ 256, and `maxSize` ≈ 64 MB via `sizeCalculation` = serialized length [ASSUMED sizing].
  - Filter the merged features to the request bbox.
  - **Do not cache study status.** Compute it per request from the DB.
- **Bounded fan-out.** `bbox` is optional and unvalidated against `zoom` (`public-parcel-statuses-query.dto.ts:3-18`). Cap tiles per request (e.g. 16). Beyond the cap, skip IGN and use the DB path. Without a cap, one request with a huge bbox would fan out into thousands of IGN calls.
- **"Studied" query bounded.** Today `surveys.service.ts:1369-1400` ranks **every** public survey in the country on each map move. Restrict it with `p.commune_code = ANY($communes)`, the set of `code_insee` values in the fetched features. Do *not* bound it by centroid bbox: parcels created through `ensureParcelById` have `centroid = {}` (`surveys.service.ts:1797-1806`), would get NULL generated columns, and would silently lose their "studied" flag.
- Replace the silent `catch {}` at `:1481` with `this.logger.warn(message)`.

### Pattern 8: Advisory lock in `scripts/migrate.js`

```js
// after client.connect(), before CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations
await client.query("SELECT pg_advisory_lock($1)", [MIGRATION_LOCK_KEY]) // constant bigint
try { /* existing loop: re-check schema_migrations per file, BEGIN/SQL/INSERT/COMMIT */ }
finally { await client.query("SELECT pg_advisory_unlock($1)", [MIGRATION_LOCK_KEY]).catch(() => {}) }
```

- Use a session-level lock, because each file runs in its own transaction. The second runner blocks, then finds every file already applied.
- **The race was reproduced today:** two concurrent `runMigrations()` calls on an empty DB → `["fulfilled","rejected: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"pg_type_typname_nsp_index\""]`.
- Why it matters in production: the image CMD is `node api/scripts/migrate.js && node api/dist/main.js` (`api/Dockerfile:37`), and `infra/vps/README.md` also documents a manual `exec api node api/scripts/migrate.js`. The two can overlap.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Requiring any new production variable without first updating `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env`.** The pull-based deploy restarts the stack with the new image, `update-stack.sh` only reports "API did not become healthy", and the service is down until a human intervenes.
- **Upgrading to `@nestjs/config@latest`.** It is ESM-only. See Pitfall 1.
- **Caching the IGN response including study status.** A new submission would not show for 24 h.
- **`DELETE FROM survey_parcels WHERE survey_id=$1` plus an `INSERT` of overlapping keys in the same CTE.** Sub-statements of one writable CTE see the same snapshot, and modifying the same row twice is unsupported [CITED: postgresql.org/docs/16/queries-with.html]. Use the disjoint `parcel_id <> ALL($ids)` delete (verified).
- **Relying on `AND` evaluation order to guard a cast.** PostgreSQL does not guarantee left-to-right evaluation of `AND`; only `CASE` orders evaluation. Hence the nested `CASE` in migration 015.
- **Moving code out of `src/surveys/` into new top-level directories.** The coverage thresholds are per directory (`jest.unit.config.js:15-25`).

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Env parsing and validation | ad-hoc `process.env.X ?? default` (≈50 reads in 12 files today) | `@nestjs/config` `validate` + class-validator | One typed source, fail-fast at bootstrap, and it is what the criterion names |
| Fetch timeout covering the body | `AbortController` + `setTimeout` + `clearTimeout` | `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` | The hand-rolled version is buggy in both copies (reproduced) |
| Bounded TTL cache | Map + timestamps | `lru-cache` (`ttl`, `max`, `maxSize`, `sizeCalculation`) | Size-bounded eviction; the container is capped at 768 MB |
| Migration mutual exclusion | lock tables or PID files | `pg_advisory_lock` | Released on disconnect; no stale-lock cleanup |
| Optimistic concurrency token | a new `row_version` column | the `xmin` system column | No migration; changes on every row update (verified) |
| Bbox index | PostGIS | STORED generated columns + btree | Owner decision (criterion: "no PostGIS"); proven sufficient at 10k |

**Key insight:** every "custom" piece in the current code (the timeout, the parcel loop, the per-parcel version loop) is where the defects are. The fixes are standard primitives, not new code.

## Runtime State Inventory

This phase renames and removes env vars and changes the schema, so this inventory applies.

| Category | Items Found | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Stored data | Schema only. New columns `parcels.centroid_lat/lng` (generated, backfilled by the `ALTER` rewrite) and new and dropped indexes. `auth_sessions` is already absent (verified on a fresh migration and on the local `ibp` DB; it cannot be verified on the VPS from here). No data values are renamed. | Migration 015 (code). No data migration. |
| Live service config | `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env` on the VPS (not in git). Per `infra/vps/env.example:6-60` it holds `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `*_EXPIRES_IN` (become ignored), **`CORS_ORIGIN=` (empty: fails the new rule)**, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` (must not be defaults), and `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` (present in the example). **Its real values are unknown to this research.** | **Owner action before merge:** set `CORS_ORIGIN=none`; confirm no default passwords; optionally delete the 4 dead token lines. Then run the pre-flight (`docker compose … run --rm --no-deps api node api/dist/config/check-config.js`) with the new image tag. |
| OS-registered state | systemd `cortege-deploy.timer/.service` runs `infra/vps/update-stack.sh` (updated from git by `merge --ff-only` on each run) | Optional hardening: have `update-stack.sh` run the config check with the new image **before** `compose up -d`, so a bad env never takes the stack down. No re-registration needed. |
| Secrets / env vars | CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:212-215, 306-309, 509-512` set `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `*_EXPIRES_IN`. Examples: `api/.env.example:29-32`, `api/.env.production.example:26-29`, `infra/.env.example:31-34`, `infra/vps/env.example:21-24`. Docs: `CLAUDE.md:286`, `README.md:85`. Tests: `test/auth.guard.spec.ts:42-48,96-97`, `test/debug-surface.spec.ts:59-72`. Also dead and never read: `AUTH_DEV_EXPOSE_EMAIL_TOKEN`, `AUTH_LOGIN_OR_CREATE_ENABLED` (in all examples and CI). | Code edit: remove from all of them. Tests import the new per-process secret helper instead of setting env. |
| Build artifacts | `api/dist/` and `api/coverage/` (local, gitignored) contain the old `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` reads | None: they are rebuilt. Exclude `dist/` and `coverage/` from verification greps. |

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: `@nestjs/config` 12 is ESM-only
**What goes wrong:** `npm install @nestjs/config` picks 12.0.1. `require()` from compiled CJS fails, and ts-jest under Jest 29 fails with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`/"Cannot use import statement outside a module".
**How to avoid:** pin `@nestjs/config@4.0.4` exactly (not `^4`, which is still fine today, but pin for clarity). This also happened for real this session: `slopcheck install` resolved `^12.0.1`.
**Warning signs:** `"type": "module"` in `node_modules/@nestjs/config/package.json`.

### Pitfall 2: Fail-fast rules take down the pull-based VPS deploy
**What goes wrong:** the new image rejects `CORS_ORIGIN=` or a default password. `update-stack.sh:40-55` has already run `compose up -d`, the health check fails 12 times, and the API stays down.
**How to avoid:**
- Ship a `check-config` entry point.
- Document and do the owner pre-deploy step (Runtime State Inventory).
- Add a CI smoke step: `docker run --rm -e NODE_ENV=production … cortege:ci node api/dist/main.js` must exit non-zero with default credentials. **Override the CMD:** the default CMD runs `migrate.js` first, which fails on the missing DB and would mask the result.

### Pitfall 3: E2E specs that boot `AppModule` in production mode
**What goes wrong:** `test/debug-surface.e2e-spec.ts:15-35` sets `NODE_ENV=production` and boots the full `AppModule` with the test env (`ibp`/`ibp`, empty `CORS_ORIGIN`). The new validation rejects it and the spec fails in `beforeAll`.
**How to avoid:** inside its `isolateModulesAsync` block, set a production-valid fake env: a non-default `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN`/`AUDIENCE`, `CORS_ORIGIN=none`, `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=local`. Restore it afterwards. `GET /v1/health` never touches the DB (`app.controller.ts`), and `pg.Pool` connects lazily, so a fake password is harmless.

### Pitfall 4: Removing `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` breaks every E2E spec and the owner simulation
**What goes wrong:** `POST /v1/debug/test-token` answers 403 "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET not set" (`debug.controller.ts:19`), and every spec's `login()` fails.
**How to avoid:**
- Generate a per-process random secret (`crypto.randomBytes(32)`) in `debug/test-token-secret.ts`, used by both the debug controller and the guard's HS256 branch, only when `NODE_ENV === "test"`.
- The E2E specs and `07-owner-check-simulation.mjs` (line 32) mint tokens through the same process, so they keep working.
- Unit specs (`auth.guard.spec.ts`, `debug-surface.spec.ts`) import the helper to sign tokens.
- `jest.isolateModulesAsync` gives each isolated registry its own secret. That is fine, because the app and the guard come from the same registry.

### Pitfall 5: Single-statement writes silently change a locked decision
**What goes wrong:** 01.4 D-06 says upsert uses `DatabaseService.transaction`. A reviewer may see the CTE fast path as a regression.
**How to avoid:** record the new decision explicitly (same atomicity, single statement). Keep the locked path as the fallback. Keep `surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` (event-insert fault injection, concurrent upserts, concurrent submits) green unchanged.

### Pitfall 6: A CAS on `sync_version` misses submit and visibility writes
**What goes wrong:** the optimistic update overwrites a survey submitted between the read and the write, because submit does not bump `sync_version`.
**How to avoid:** use `xmin` as the CAS token (verified). Also keep `AND sync_version < $n` and `status <> 'submitted'` in the `WHERE` clause.

### Pitfall 7: The timeout covers headers only
**What goes wrong:** the IGN server sends headers and stalls the body, and the request hangs until the socket dies. Under load this pins event-loop work and connections.
**Evidence (Node 22.22):** the current pattern is still hanging after 1 500 ms; `AbortSignal.timeout(300)` rejects at 307 ms with `TimeoutError`. The same defect exists in `auth.guard.ts:217` (`/userinfo`, no timeout at all).

### Pitfall 8: Tile fan-out amplification
**What goes wrong:** per-tile fetching turns one request with a country-sized bbox into thousands of outbound WFS calls.
**How to avoid:** cap the tiles per request, use bounded concurrency, and fall back to the DB path beyond the cap. The rate limit (600/min per client, `rate-limit.config.ts:13-18`) does not bound the *outbound* fan-out per request.

### Pitfall 9: The cursor cast bug returns in new list cursors
**What goes wrong:** a list cursor decoded with only `Date.parse` accepts `2024-02-30`, and the `::timestamptz` cast throws 22008, giving a 500.
**How to avoid:** use one strict validator (regex plus a component round-trip) for the legacy sync cursor and the new list cursors. As defence in depth, map 22007/22008 raised by the cursor query to `BadRequestException("Invalid sync cursor")`.

### Pitfall 10: The generated-column cast aborts the migration
Covered in Pattern 6. Run the migration spec against seeded bad rows (`"abc"`, `{}`, out-of-range, numeric strings) in a scratch schema, the way `test/migration-014-survey-events-seq.e2e-spec.ts` does.

### Pitfall 11: The EXPLAIN seed pollutes other E2E specs
**What goes wrong:** 2 000 extra public surveys push the test fixtures out of `LIMIT 500` in public-map assertions.
**How to avoid:** seed, `ANALYZE`, `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` and `ROLLBACK` in one transaction. `ANALYZE` is allowed inside a transaction block; verified that the rollback restores the table. Specs run `--runInBand`, so the long transaction's snapshot does not stall other specs' `xid8` feed.

### Pitfall 12: The partial index is used, but the plan still seq-scans
**What goes wrong:** the index alone leaves `Seq Scan on survey_parcels` in map-items, because the plan aggregates all 2 000 public surveys before the `LIMIT`.
**How to avoid:** the limit-first rewrite (Pattern 6 table). Assert "no Seq Scan on surveys|parcels|survey_parcels" in the JSON plan.

## Code Examples

### 1. Config validation (class-validator, 4.0.4 `validate` hook)
```typescript
// Source: docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration (custom validate function), adapted
import { plainToInstance } from "class-transformer"
import { IsIn, IsInt, IsOptional, IsString, Max, Min, validateSync } from "class-validator"

export class EnvironmentVariables {
  @IsIn(["development", "test", "production"]) NODE_ENV: string = "development"
  @IsInt() @Min(1) @Max(65535) PORT: number = 3000
  @IsString() POSTGRES_HOST: string = "localhost"
  @IsString() POSTGRES_PASSWORD: string = "ibp"
  @IsOptional() @IsString() CORS_ORIGIN?: string
  @IsOptional() @IsString() AUTH0_AUDIENCE?: string
  // … every variable in the Pattern 1 table
}

export function validateEnv(raw: Record<string, unknown>): EnvironmentVariables {
  const env = plainToInstance(EnvironmentVariables, raw, { enableImplicitConversion: true })
  const errors = validateSync(env, { skipMissingProperties: false })
  if (errors.length > 0) throw new Error(`Invalid configuration: ${errors.map(String).join("; ")}`)
  if (env.NODE_ENV === "production") assertProductionSafety(env) // throws with variable names only, never values
  return env
}
```
Error messages must name variables, never echo their values: secrets end up in `docker logs`.

### 2. CORS
```typescript
// app.setup.ts (replaces :24-29)
const origins = config.corsOrigins // [] when CORS_ORIGIN === "none"; list otherwise; dev default: true
app.enableCors({ origin: origins === true ? true : origins.length ? origins : false, methods: [...], credentials: false })
```
`credentials: false` is safe: no cookies anywhere in `api/src` (`grep -ri cookie` is empty), and auth is Bearer only.

### 3. Auth failure log (message + code only)
```typescript
// auth.guard.ts:73 replacement
const e = err as { name?: string; message?: string; code?: string }
this.logger.warn(`Token validation failed: ${e.name ?? "Error"}: ${e.message ?? "unknown"}${e.code ? ` (code=${e.code})` : ""}`)
```
**What leaks today** (`console.error(..., err)`) is the whole error object with its stack, on every bad token (a log-flooding vector). For a pg error on the provisioning path, that includes `detail`, which can carry an email (`Key (email)=(…) already exists`). For JWT errors, the expected audience and issuer. The message text keeps the useful part.

### 4. Query-budget spec (instrument proven this session)
```typescript
// api/test/sync-query-budget.e2e-spec.ts
import { Client } from "pg"
const spy = jest.spyOn(Client.prototype, "query")
await request(app.getHttpServer()).post("/v1/sync").set("Authorization", `Bearer ${token}`).send(batch).expect(200)
const count = spy.mock.calls.length; spy.mockRestore()
// BASELINE_* recorded 2026-09-25 before the change (1 001 creates/1 parcel, 901 updates/1 parcel)
expect(count).toBeLessThanOrEqual(Math.floor(BASELINE_CREATES_1P / 3))
```
It works because `pg.Pool#query` and the transaction adapter both go through `Client.prototype.query` of the single hoisted `pg` (`/node_modules/pg`). Also assert that all 100 results are `synced`.

### 5. EXPLAIN reproduction on 10 000 surveys (script for the PR)
```sql
-- run inside BEGIN … ROLLBACK against a *_test DB (or a scratch DB) after migrations
INSERT INTO users(id,email,auth0_sub) SELECT gen_random_uuid(),'u'||g||'@x','auth0|'||g FROM generate_series(1,200) g;
INSERT INTO parcels(id,parcel_id,commune_code,section,number,centroid,source)
  SELECT gen_random_uuid(), lpad((g%90000)::text,5,'0')||'AB'||lpad(g::text,4,'0'), lpad((g%90000)::text,5,'0'),'AB',

  SELECT 's'||g,(SELECT a[1+(g%200)] FROM u),'Site '||g,
         CASE WHEN g%5<2 THEN 'submitted' ELSE 'draft' END, CASE WHEN g%10<2 THEN 'public' ELSE 'private' END,
         'ACA', jsonb_build_object('ibp_total',g%50), now()-(g||' min')::interval, now()-(g||' min')::interval,
         CASE WHEN g%5<2 THEN now()-(g||' min')::interval END, now()+interval '7 days',1,2020+g%6,1
  FROM generate_series(1,10000) g;
INSERT INTO survey_parcels(survey_id,parcel_id)
  SELECT 's'||g,p.parcel_id FROM generate_series(1,10000) g
  JOIN LATERAL (SELECT parcel_id FROM parcels ORDER BY parcel_id OFFSET (g*7)%8000 LIMIT 1+g%3) p ON true
  ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
ANALYZE;
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) <map-items query>;  EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) <parcel-status bbox query>;
```
Commit it as `api/scripts/explain-public-routes.sql` (or a `.js` wrapper that refuses non-`_test`/scratch DB names, reusing `test/e2e-env.js`'s `assertResettableDatabase`). Attach its before/after output to the PR.

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| `@nestjs/config` Joi `validationSchema` | Standard Schema (zod, valibot, arktype) in `@nestjs/config` 12 | 12.0.0, 2026-08-27 | Not usable here (ESM-only, see Pitfall 1). The `validate` function works in both lines. |
| `AbortController` + `setTimeout` | `AbortSignal.timeout()` | Node 17.3 / 16.14 | Covers the whole fetch lifecycle |
| NestJS 11 | NestJS 12 (`@nestjs/common` 12.1.0) | 2026 | Out of scope; note for hygiene |

**Deprecated/outdated in this repo:**
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `*_EXPIRES_IN`, `AUTH_DEV_EXPOSE_EMAIL_TOKEN` and `AUTH_LOGIN_OR_CREATE_ENABLED`: never read by `api/src`.
- The `auth_sessions` table: dropped by migration 011.
- The audit's "1 570 lines" is now 1 896.

## Assumptions Log

| # | Claim | Section | Risk if Wrong |
|---|-------|---------|---------------|
| A1 | The VPS `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env` follows `infra/vps/env.example`: `CORS_ORIGIN` empty, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` set, non-default passwords | Runtime State Inventory, Pitfall 2 | Production outage on deploy if a rule fails. Mitigated by the pre-flight check and the owner step. |
| A2 | Tile zoom 15, ≤16 tiles per request, `max` 256 and `maxSize` 64 MB are adequate | Pattern 7 | Too small: low hit rate. Too large: memory pressure in 768 MB. Tune after deploy. |
| A3 | `@nestjs/config` and `lru-cache` are legitimate (slopcheck output not captured) | Package audit | Very low: official NestJS org and isaacs, both on registry and GitHub |
| A4 | `pgsty/minio:RELEASE.2026-08-04…` starts on the existing VPS `/data` volume written by `RELEASE.2025-09-07` | Carried-in items | Storage down after the image switch. Needs a VPS check with a backup of the volume first. |
| A5 | `xmin` CAS is safe under this workload (no wraparound concern within a read→write window of milliseconds) | Pattern 4 | Negligible. The slow path still re-reads under lock. |
| A6 | 10 s `statement_timeout` never cuts a legitimate statement | Pattern 2 | A 500 or a retryable sync error. Configurable via env. |

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

All three were answered by the owner and recorded in 08-CONTEXT.md: question 1 by D-03 (`CORS_ORIGIN=none`), question 2 by D-17 (one owner VPS visit before the merge, with the pre-flight check; sequence refined by D-19 and D-21), question 3 by D-16 and D-19 (compose files move to `pgsty/minio`; the switch happens at deploy after a volume backup).

Keep them short. The owner reads French.

1. **CORS en production.** Le VPS a aujourd'hui `CORS_ORIGIN=` (vide). Proposition : écrire `CORS_ORIGIN=none` (l'app mobile n'a pas besoin de CORS). Une valeur vide ou absente empêchera l'API de démarrer. D'accord ?
   - Recommendation: yes. The planner encodes `none` as the explicit "CORS disabled" value.
2. **Fichier `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env`.** Avant la mise en production de cette phase, il faut vérifier sur le VPS : mot de passe Postgres et clé secrète MinIO différents des valeurs par défaut, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` rempli, `CORS_ORIGIN=none`. Qui le fait, et quand ?
   - Recommendation: the owner, just before the merge. Claude provides the one-line check command.
3. **Image MinIO.** Profiter de cette phase pour passer les deux fichiers compose (local et VPS) à l'image `pgsty/minio` épinglée, comme dans la CI ? Il faudra redémarrer MinIO sur le VPS une fois, après une sauvegarde du volume.
   - Recommendation: yes, as a separate small plan in the same owner visit.

Technical points resolved by this research (no owner input needed):
- `auth_sessions` is already dropped; a safety migration and a test are enough.
- The query budget needs single-statement writes; record it as a decision in CONTEXT.md.
- `AUTH0_MGMT_*` get a startup warning, not a refusal.

## Environment Availability

| Dependency | Required By | Available | Version | Fallback |
|------------|------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Node.js | build, tests | ✓ | v22.22.2 | — |
| PostgreSQL | E2E, migration spec, EXPLAIN | ✓ | 16.13 (localhost:5432, role `ibp`/`ibp`) | — |
| Docker | CI smoke reproduction, MinIO-mode E2E | ✓ | Engine 29.3.1 | CI runs it anyway |
| npm registry | installing `@nestjs/config`, `lru-cache` | ✓ | — | — |
| `pgsty/minio` image | MinIO-mode E2E, compose switch | ✓ in CI (`ci.yml:349`, pinned by digest) | RELEASE.2026-08-04 | — |
| VPS shell access | env pre-flight, MinIO switch | ✗ from this environment | — | Owner action (Open Questions 2-3) |
| IGN endpoints | real WFS behaviour | not needed | — | Unit tests with a local stalling HTTP server; E2E uses `CADASTRE_PROVIDER=synthetic` |

**Missing dependencies with no fallback:** VPS access, for the owner-only steps.

**Local E2E note:** there is no `api/.env` in this checkout. Today E2E needs `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` in the environment. After this phase it needs nothing, because the per-process secret replaces it.

## Validation Architecture

### Test Framework

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework | Jest 29.7 + ts-jest 29.4; Supertest 7 for E2E |
| Config file | `api/jest.unit.config.js` (unit, per-directory coverage ratchet), `api/jest.config.js` (E2E, globalSetup resets the `*_test` DB) |
| Quick run command | `npm --workspace api run test:unit -- <pattern>` |
| Full suite command | `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test:unit && npm run format:check`, plus `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p17_test OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=local ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p17 flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock npm --workspace api run test:e2e` (one DB per plan, serialized, as in 01.6) |

### Sampling Rate
- **Per task commit:** the quick unit command for the touched area, plus `npm run typecheck`.
- **Per wave merge:** the full suite command (unit + E2E, local mode). The MinIO-mode E2E runs in CI.
- **Phase gate:** full suite green, the query-budget and EXPLAIN specs green, and the owner simulation replay (01.6 script adapted: test-token without `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`) recorded in VALIDATION.md.

### Wave 0 Gaps
- [ ] `api/test/sync-query-budget.e2e-spec.ts`: run once on the current code to confirm the recorded baseline (1 001 / 901 / 1 301 / 1 101).
- [ ] `api/test/env.schema.spec.ts`
- [ ] `api/test/list-pagination.e2e-spec.ts`
- [ ] `api/test/migration-015-public-indexes.e2e-spec.ts`
- [ ] `api/test/migrate-lock.e2e-spec.ts`
- [ ] `api/test/public-routes-explain.e2e-spec.ts`
- [ ] Coverage threshold entry for the new `./src/config/` directory in `api/jest.unit.config.js` (ratchet at the measured value)

## Security Domain

### Applicable ASVS Categories

| ASVS Category | Applies | Standard Control |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| V1 Architecture / V14 Configuration | yes | Fail-fast validated config; no default credentials in production; no secret values in error messages |
| V2 Authentication | yes (indirect) | HS256 test path only when `NODE_ENV=test` (DebugModule absent in production, `app.module.ts`); per-process random secret removes a guessable/shared secret |
| V3 Session Management | no | Stateless JWT; `auth_sessions` gone |
| V4 Access Control | yes | Column-scoped `findOwned` keeps the `user_id` predicate; pagination never widens scope (keyset inside the same `WHERE user_id`) |
| V5 Input Validation | yes | Strict cursor decoding (regex + date round-trip); `limit` bounded 1..100; bbox tile cap |
| V7 Error Handling and Logging | yes | Auth failures log name/message/code only; pool errors logged; no pg `detail` in logs |
| V8 Data Protection | yes | Logs no longer carry emails from pg `detail` |
| V12 / V13 Resources and API | yes | `statement_timeout`, `connectionTimeoutMillis`, fetch timeouts, bounded cache, bounded outbound fan-out |

### Known Threat Patterns for this stack

| Pattern | STRIDE | Standard Mitigation |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Starting production with `ibp`/`minio123` defaults | Elevation of Privilege | `assertProductionSafety` at bootstrap |
| Cross-origin credentialed requests (`origin: true` + `credentials: true`) | Spoofing | `origin: false` unless an explicit allow-list; `credentials: false` |
| Log flooding / PII in logs through bad tokens | Information Disclosure / DoS | Message + code only, `warn` level |
| Pool exhaustion or slow statement pins every request | DoS | `connectionTimeoutMillis`, `statement_timeout`, `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` |
| Stalled upstream body (IGN, Auth0 `/userinfo`) | DoS | `AbortSignal.timeout` on the whole fetch |
| Huge-bbox fan-out to IGN | DoS (amplification) | Tile cap per request, bounded concurrency, DB fallback |
| Cache memory exhaustion | DoS | `lru-cache` `maxSize` + `sizeCalculation` |
| Malformed cursor → DB cast error → 500 | DoS / Info | Strict decode → 400; map 22007/22008 on cursor queries |
| Concurrent migration runs | Tampering (half-applied schema) | `pg_advisory_lock` |
| Lost update between read and optimistic write | Tampering | `xmin` CAS + locked slow path |

- https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration: `validate` function, `forRoot` options; the current docs describe v12 and Standard Schema.
- https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool: defaults, the `error` event warning, client options accepted by Pool.
- https://node-postgres.com/apis/client: `statement_timeout`, `query_timeout`, `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, `application_name`.
- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/queries-with.html: data-modifying statements in `WITH` share one snapshot [CITED; semantics also verified locally].

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- Tile-cache sizing figures (A2).

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH. Versions and module formats verified on the registry and in the tarball.
- Architecture (split boundary, order): HIGH on the facts; MEDIUM on the exact file sizes after the split (the target is < 600 lines per file).
- Query budget: MEDIUM-HIGH. Baseline measured; the target statements proven in SQL; the TS implementation is not yet written.
- DB tuning: HIGH. DDL and plans reproduced on PG 16.13 at 10k.
- Pitfalls: HIGH. Most were reproduced.

**Research date:** 2026-09-25
**Valid until:** 2026-10-25 (the stack is stable; recheck `@nestjs/config` 4.x maintenance if the phase slips)
