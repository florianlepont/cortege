# Phase 01.7: API configuration, service split and database tuning Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The API fails fast on bad configuration, its survey logic is split into reviewable units, and its queries are bounded and indexed.
**Verified:** 2026-09-26T07:38:52Z
**Status:** human_needed (one owner-only SQL check on production; no code gaps)
**Re-verification:** No, initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (Roadmap Success Criteria, plus the deploy guard)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Configuration is read through `@nestjs/config` with a schema validated at startup. Production refuses to start on default credentials or an empty `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`. `CORS_ORIGIN` is required in production. `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` and `ACCESS_TOKEN_*` are gone. | ✓ VERIFIED | `api/package.json` pins `@nestjs/config` to `4.0.4`. `app.module.ts` registers `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal, validate: validateEnv, load: [appConfig] })`. `env.schema.ts` is a class-validator schema, and `validateEnv` calls `assertProductionSafety` when `NODE_ENV=production`. `production-rules.ts` refuses the following: an empty or default `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (`ibp`, `minio`, `minio123`, empty, or a case-insensitive `change[-_]?me` prefix); an empty or default `OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` in MinIO mode; an empty `AUTH0_DOMAIN` or `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`; a missing, empty, placeholder or malformed `CORS_ORIGIN`. `none` is accepted, and so is a list of `https://host` entries. Missing `AUTH0_MGMT_*` values give warnings only. `grep process.env api/src` finds reads only under `src/config/` (`currentNodeEnv`, `loadAppConfig`, the CLI entry). ESLint bans them anywhere else, and lint exits 0. `app.setup.ts` turns `cors.mode === "none"` into `origin: false`. I ran the built `node api/dist/main.js` with `NODE_ENV=production POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ibp OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=minio123`: it exits 1, names the variables, and prints `minio123` 0 times. `check-config.js` exits 1 with only `CORS_ORIGIN` empty, and again with only `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` empty. `git grep` for the four token variables outside `.planning` hits only the audit docs, `check-env.sh`'s dead-variable INFO list and its parity spec. The HS256 test path and `POST /debug/test-token` share `getTestTokenSecret`: `crypto.randomBytes(32)` once per process, and `null` outside `NODE_ENV=test`. Production answers `POST /v1/debug/test-token` with 404 (I probed it). |
| 2 | The `pg` pool has `max`, `idleTimeoutMillis`, `statement_timeout` and an `error` listener. Services log through the Nest `Logger`. A failed authentication logs only its message and code. | ✓ VERIFIED | `database.service.ts` builds the `Pool` with `max` (10), `idleTimeoutMillis` (30000), `connectionTimeoutMillis` (5000), `statement_timeout` (10000), `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` (60000) and `application_name`. Each can be overridden through `PG_*` in the validated config. `pool.on("error")` logs only the message and code through `Logger`. `grep "console\." api/src` finds nothing, and ESLint enforces it. In `auth.guard.ts`, `describeAuthFailure` builds `Token validation failed: <name>: <message> (code=<code>)` from typed fields only. The error object, stack, token and header are never passed to the logger. `fetchUserInfo` uses `AbortSignal.timeout(httpTimeoutMs)` and awaits `.json()` inside the timed region. |
| 3 | `SurveysService` is split into repository, survey, events, parcels (the internal IGN client merged into `CadastreProviderService`) and public-map services. `getSurveyForUser` and `insertEvent` exist once. | ✓ VERIFIED | New units: `surveys.repository.ts` (454 lines, `findOwned`/`findOwnedOrThrow`, the list keyset, the D-09 CTEs), `survey-events.service.ts` (`insert`, `listForSurvey`), `parcels.service.ts`, `public-map.service.ts` with `public-map.queries.ts`, and `cadastre-provider.service.ts`, which now holds the only IGN WFS client. `surveys.service.ts` shrank from 1 896 lines to 1 195. `SurveysDataModule` exports the repository and events service, and both `SurveysModule` and `ReportsModule` import it. `ReportsService` writes its `reported` event through `this.events.insert(db, surveyId, null, …)`. Grep results: `getSurveyForUser` and `insertEvent` appear 0 times in `api/src`, because the plan renamed them to their single successors. There is exactly one `findOwned<` definition. `INSERT INTO survey_events` is spelled once (`survey-events.sql.ts`), and it is used by `SurveyEventsService.insert` and the two fast-path CTEs. The criterion's intent, one implementation of each, holds. The names changed (see Anti-Patterns, info). The E2E suites still pass unchanged. |
| 4 | Parcel ids are written in one batched statement. Ownership checks select only the columns they need. `listForUser`, `getEvents` and `listReports` paginate by cursor and still answer unpaginated callers. The IGN fetch caches per tile and times out on the body. A 100-operation sync batch issues at least 3x fewer queries. | ✓ VERIFIED | `ParcelsService.ensureParcelIds` uses one `INSERT … SELECT FROM unnest(…) ON CONFLICT (parcel_id) DO NOTHING`, sorted by `parcel_id`. `validateParcelSubmit` is one `GROUP BY` query, and `displayLocation` is one query on the generated columns. `findOwned` picks its SELECT list from a constant: `ownership` = `id, user_id, status, visibility, sync_version, deleted_at`, or `full`. The six attachment checks, the events check and the delete check use `ownership`. The `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2` predicate is kept in every mode. The three controllers take `limit`/`cursor` as individual `@Query` strings. `parseListLimit` accepts 1..100, and a missing limit gives `null`. `toListPage` returns every row with `next_cursor: null` when `limit` is null. Before the phase, the responses were `{ items, next_cursor: null }` for `/surveys` and `{ items }` for events and reports (checked on `abcfcf6`), so the change is additive only. `decodeListCursor` is strict (`v1:` prefix, canonical base64url, exactly the keys `t`/`i`, `isStrictTimestamp`, id pattern). Every failure is a fixed 400 that does not echo the input. For IGN, `fetchJson` uses `AbortSignal.timeout(timeoutMs)` and `await response.json()` inside that timeout. The cache is an `LRUCache` of z15 tiles (256 entries, 64 MB, 24 h TTL), capped at 16 tiles per request with 4 in flight, and a failure is logged as a warning and falls back to the DB path. Query budget: I re-ran `sync-query-budget.e2e-spec.ts` here and got 201 statements in all four cases (baselines 1 001 / 901 / 1 301 / 1 101, so 4.5x–6.5x). A single create costs 3 statements with 1 parcel and with 50. The legacy-cursor 500 carried from 01.6 is closed: strict validation, plus a backstop that maps 22007/22008/22009 to 400 (`surveys-sync.service.ts:407-409`), and the 01.6 repro strings are covered in `sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts:262`. |
| 5 | The public-surveys partial index and the generated `centroid_lat`/`centroid_lng` columns with a btree index exist (no PostGIS). Migrations take a `pg_advisory_lock`. The dead `auth_sessions` tables are dropped. EXPLAIN ANALYZE on 10 000 surveys is attached to the PR. | ✓ VERIFIED | `migrations/015_public_indexes_centroid_columns.sql` creates the partial `idx_surveys_public_submitted`. It adds `centroid_lat`/`centroid_lng` as `GENERATED ALWAYS … STORED` behind a nested `CASE` (regex, then range), plus the btree `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng`. It also adds `idx_survey_events_actor_id` and `idx_reports_created_id`, drops the three redundant indexes, and runs `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS auth_sessions CASCADE`. `auth_sessions` is the only such table ever created (006, already dropped by 011). There is no PostGIS. `scripts/migrate.js` takes `pg_advisory_lock($1)` before the loop and unlocks in `finally`. `migrate-lock.e2e-spec.ts` and `migration-015-public-indexes.e2e-spec.ts` pass here. The public queries were rewritten: map items read the partial index first with a LATERAL aggregate, and the bbox query filters on `centroid_lat/lng`. `08-explain-10k.txt` is committed with the phase and was merged through PR #156. It holds 12 plans. Its 3 `Seq Scan` lines are all in the "before" sections (lines 22, 72, 91), and none are in "after". The PR #156 body (fetched from the GitHub API) reports "map items 19.8 → 4.4 ms; parcel status 18.0 → 1.4 ms. No sequential scan remains." Production answers `GET /v1/public/map-items` with 200, which means migration 015 ran. |
| 6 | Deploy guard: a bad env file never takes the API down, the first deploy already ran the guarded script, and `check-env.sh` agrees with `check-config.js`. | ✓ VERIFIED | `update-stack.sh` does the following: (1) Fingerprints itself before `merge --ff-only`. (2) If the script changed, it re-execs the new copy once, guarded by `CORTEGE_UPDATE_STACK_REEXEC`. (3) It compares the pulled image with the one the container actually runs, so a refused deploy is retried after the env is fixed. (4) It runs `compose run --rm --no-deps api node api/dist/config/check-config.js` before `compose up -d`, and exits 1 without restarting on failure. That path matches the Dockerfile (`WORKDIR /app`, `COPY … /app/api/dist ./api/dist`, and a `CMD` with no `ENTRYPOINT`, so the `run` command replaces it). `check-env.sh` parses the file as text with no `source` or `eval`. It maps the compose-imposed values and applies the same rules as `production-rules.ts`. I ran it on two fixtures: valid gives exit 0 with the OK line, and `CORS_ORIGIN=` plus `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Change_Me_now` gives exit 1 naming both. It printed 0 secret values. The parity spec `check-env-parity.spec.ts` and the bash harness `vps-deploy-guard.spec.ts` pass in the unit suite. CI has the step "Smoke test — production refuses default configuration" (`ci.yml:521`). The deploy journal in VALIDATION.md shows the new script's wording ("the API already runs the latest image, nothing to do"). |

### Probe Execution

No probes are declared for this phase, and `scripts/*/tests/probe-*.sh` does not exist. The owner-check simulation (`scripts/owner-check-simulation.mjs`) is a plan artifact whose 57/57 run is recorded in VALIDATION.md. I did not re-run it, because it needs a running API and MinIO. Its production-phase checks are covered by my own read-only probes above.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |

| REQ-AUD-config | Plans 01, 04, 05, 06, 07, 14 | Validated schema, bounded pool, strict CORS, Nest Logger, dead secrets removed | ✓ SATISFIED | Truths 1, 2, 6 |
| REQ-AUD-surveys-split | Plans 02, 03, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12 | Split services, batched writes, column-scoped ownership, cursor pagination, cached and timed IGN | ✓ SATISFIED | Truths 3, 4 |
| REQ-AUD-db-tuning | Plans 03, 10, 13 | Partial index, generated centroid columns, advisory lock, `auth_sessions` dropped | ✓ SATISFIED | Truth 5 |

No orphaned requirements: REQUIREMENTS.md maps only these three IDs to Phase 1.7.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `api/src/app.module.ts` / Nest `ExceptionHandler` | — | On a refused production configuration, Nest's own `ExceptionHandler` logs the error with its stack trace (dist file paths) before `main.ts` logs the one-line message. | ℹ️ Info | No value leaks: only variable names and file paths. `main.ts`'s "message only" comment is not fully true, because Nest logs first. Cosmetic. |
| Roadmap criterion 3 wording | — | The literal names `getSurveyForUser` and `insertEvent` occur 0 times, not once. They were renamed to `SurveysRepository.findOwned` and `SurveyEventsService.insert` (plan 08's grep gate asserts 0 old names and 1 definition). | ℹ️ Info | The intent (one implementation each) holds. |
| `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts` | — | Still 1 195 lines (was 1 896) | ℹ️ Info | It keeps upsert, patch, visibility, submit, delete and getById, as D-07 intends. The file-size target of 01.9 does not apply to the API. |
| `08-VALIDATION.md` | frontmatter, rows 76-78, sign-off | `status: draft`, the three plan-14 rows still ⬜, `Approval: pending`, even though the CI, owner-visit and post-deploy sections record them as done | ℹ️ Info | Bookkeeping only |

A grep for `TBD|FIXME|XXX|TODO|HACK` across the files the phase changed under `api`, `infra`, `.github`, `scripts` and `docs` (`abcfcf6..b4b62d3`) found nothing.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Production centroid guard count

**Test:** On the VPS database, run `SELECT count(*) FROM parcels WHERE centroid <> '{}' AND centroid_lat IS NULL`.
**Expected:** `0`.
**Why human:** Only the owner has access to the production database. VALIDATION.md lists this as the check to run after migrating, and the 01.7-14 SUMMARY records it as not done. From the code, a non-zero count is unlikely, for three reasons. First, jsonb never renders numbers in exponent form. Second, the guard accepts up to 30 decimals, which covers full double precision (fixed in `8e939fe`). Third, string-typed centroids also match the regex. A non-zero count would still silently drop those parcels from the public bbox and from the map-items averages, so the owner should run it once.

### Gaps Summary

There are no code gaps. I checked all five roadmap success criteria and the deploy guard against the source, not the SUMMARYs:

- **Configuration:** config validation and the production refusals, confirmed on the built API and CLI. CORS `none` in production, confirmed on the live host. The per-process test secret, with the dead token variables gone.
- **Pool and logging:** the bounded pool with its error listener, Logger-only output, and the auth failure log with name, message and code only.
- **Service split:** the split into repository, events, parcels, public-map and cadastre units, with one event writer and one ownership lookup.
- **Queries:** batched parcel writes, the constant ownership column list, additive cursor pagination with a strict codec, and the tile-cached IGN client timed through the body. The query budget was re-measured here at 201 statements against baselines of 901 to 1 301.
- **Migrations:** migration 015 is live in production, the migration runner takes an advisory lock, and the EXPLAIN evidence shows no `Seq Scan` after the change.
- **Deploy:** the guarded, self-re-executing `update-stack.sh`, and a text-only `check-env.sh` that agrees with `check-config.js`.

The unit suite (631) and the full local E2E suite (170 passed, 3 MinIO-only skipped, with every removed token variable unset) pass here. The status is `human_needed` only because of the one owner-only production SQL check above.

_Verified: 2026-09-26T07:38:52Z_
_Verifier: gsd-verifier_

## Human verification result (2026-09-26)

The owner ran `SELECT count(*) FROM parcels WHERE centroid <> '{}' AND centroid_lat IS NULL` on production. Result: 0. No parcel lost its generated centroid, so the status is now passed.
