# Phase 01.7 Plan 08: SurveysRepository, SurveyEventsService and SurveysDataModule Summary

**Survey events are now written by one method, `SurveyEventsService.insert`, and ownership is checked by one lookup, `SurveysRepository.findOwned`. That lookup has a constant "ownership" column list for the attachment, delete and events checks. Both units live in the exported `SurveysDataModule`. The three `insertEvent` copies (including the inline one in reports), the two `getSurveyForUser*` pairs and the parcel-link helpers are gone. The full E2E suite passes in local and MinIO modes with no spec edits.**

## Accomplishments

- **SurveyEventsService (D-07):**
  - `insert(db, surveyId, actorId: string | null, eventType, payload)` issues `SURVEY_EVENT_INSERT_SQL VALUES ($1..$5::jsonb)` with a fresh `randomUUID()` and `JSON.stringify(payload)` on the caller's Queryable. `seq` and `xid` are never named.
  - `listForSurvey` checks ownership with `findOwnedOrThrow(..., { activeOnly: true, columns: "ownership" })` (activeOnly true, as in the old `getEvents`) and runs the old SELECT unchanged.
- **SurveysRepository (D-07):**
  - One generic `findOwned<C extends OwnershipColumns>` definition plus `findOwnedOrThrow` (`NotFoundException("Survey not found")`).
  - `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2` is kept in every mode. `activeOnly` adds `AND deleted_at IS NULL` and `forUpdate` appends `FOR UPDATE`.
  - `getSurveyParcelIds` and `syncSurveyParcels` were moved byte for byte.
- **Rewiring:**
  - Column mode per call site:

    | Service | Call site | Columns |
    |---------|-----------|---------|
    | SurveysService | upsert, 4 lookups, all `forUpdate` with activeOnly false | full |
    | SurveysService | patch | full |
    | SurveysService | visibility | full (see Deviations) |
    | SurveysService | getById | full |
    | SurveysService | submit (`forUpdate`) | full |
    | SurveysService | delete (activeOnly false) | ownership |
    | SurveysService | events (now `SurveyEventsService`) | ownership |
    | SurveysAttachmentsService | create (`forUpdate`), upload, delete, list, download, content | ownership |

  - Every event insert keeps its Queryable, so each event stays in the same transaction as before.
  - `ReportsService` calls `this.events.insert(db, surveyId, null, "reported", { report_id })` inside its transaction.
- **Modules:** `SurveysModule` imports `[AuthModule, StorageModule, SurveysDataModule]` and `ReportsModule` imports `[AuthModule, SurveysDataModule]`. `SurveysDataModule` imports neither, so there is no cycle. The controller `events` route delegates to `SurveyEventsService.listForSurvey`, with the same path, pipe and response.
- **Invariants kept:**
  - Transaction boundaries are unchanged.
  - Storage cleanup still runs after commit in `deleteSurvey` and `deleteAttachment` (01.4 D-07).
  - The submit path still takes the survey lock first, then the sorted parcel `FOR UPDATE` (01.4 D-08).
  - The same-version re-read, classify and replay blocks are untouched (01.6 D-04/D-16).
- **Size:** `surveys.service.ts` went from 1895 to 1835 lines.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: SurveyEventsService, SurveysRepository and SurveysDataModule:** `252b957` (feat). RED first: both new specs failed to compile because the modules did not exist. Then GREEN: 2 suites, 15/15.
2. **Task 2: Rewire surveys, attachments and reports onto the shared units and delete the duplicates:** `8021fd0` (refactor).

There is one commit per task at the orchestrator's request, so there is no separate `test(...)` RED commit.

## Verification

- Grep gates:
  - `(insertEvent|getSurveyForUser|getSurveyForUserOrThrow)\(` in api/src: 0.
  - `INSERT INTO survey_events` in api/src: 1 (the constant).
  - `^\s*(async )?findOwned<` in api/src: 1.
  - `columns: "ownership"` in surveys-attachments.service.ts: 6.
  - `SELECT \*` in surveys.repository.ts: only the "full" constant.
- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 23 suites, 519/519 passed, every threshold met. `src/surveys` is at 58.62% statements, 46.36% branches, 56.98% functions and 58.59% lines (floor 56/41/51/56).
- Full E2E, local mode, `ibp_p17_08_test`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` unset, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`: 21 suites, 137 passed, 3 skipped (the MinIO-only cases), 140 total.
- Full E2E, MinIO mode (container `p17-08-minio` on port 19200, pinned `pgsty/minio` digest from ci.yml, removed afterwards), same database and flags: 21 suites, 139 passed, 1 skipped, 140 total.
- The reported-event null actor is proven end to end by `epic-e-search-reports.e2e-spec.ts` (`actor_id` toBeNull on the owner feed). The events unit spec also checks that null reaches the query.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` are clean, and `prettier --check` on all 12 changed files is clean.
- No `*.e2e-spec.ts` file is touched by this plan's commits.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Correctness] patchSurveyVisibility uses "full", not "ownership"**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** The plan's call-site list marks the visibility lookup as "ownership". However, the no-op branch returns `existing.updated_at`, and `updated_at` is not one of the six ownership columns. With "ownership" it would be undefined, so the response shape would change.
- **Fix:** It stays on `columns: "full"`, following the plan's own rule to use "full" whenever any other field is read, with a comment at the call site.
- **Files modified:** api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts
- **Commit:** 8021fd0

No other deviations.

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree had no `node_modules`. The root, api and mobile `node_modules` are symlinked from `/home/user/cortege` (untracked, not committed).
- E2E runs used the scratchpad wrapper `p08-e2e.sh`. It sources `e2e-env.sh` with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p17_08_test`, unsets `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, uses `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p17-08`, and adds the MinIO variables in minio mode.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. No new route or trust boundary. The threats are mitigated as planned:
- **T-01.7-31:** the owner predicate is asserted in every mode by unit tests, and the E2E suite is unchanged.
- **T-01.7-32:** the null actor is covered by unit and E2E tests.
- **T-01.7-33:** every call passes the caller's Queryable, and the fault-injection E2E is green.
- **T-01.7-34:** the SELECT prefix is a constant picked by the enum.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plans 09-12 continue the surveys.service.ts split from these units. `SURVEY_EVENT_INSERT_SQL` is ready for plan 12's CTE, and `listForSurvey` is ready for plan 11's pagination.
