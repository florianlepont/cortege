# Phase 01.7 Plan 02: Strict cursor validator and legacy sync cursor 400 fix Summary

One strict timestamp validator (regex plus date round-trip) now guards both the legacy
`created_at|id` sync cursor and the new opaque `v1:` base64url list cursor, and a SQLSTATE
backstop maps any remaining timestamp cast failure on `/v1/sync/changes` to 400 instead of 500.

## What was built

### Task 1: strict validator, strict legacy cursor, list-cursor codec (commit 8054341)
- `isStrictTimestamp(value)` in `api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts`: the full regex from
  RESEARCH Pattern 5, then a round-trip of year, month, day, hour, minute and second through the
  UTC setters. It accepts PostgreSQL `timestamptz::text` output
  (`2026-03-09 10:20:31.991234+00`) and ISO strings. It rejects Feb 30, Feb 29 in non-leap years,
  month 13, hour 24, minute or second 60, trailing junk, a missing offset, seven fractional digits,
  year 0 and offsets beyond +/-15:59.
- `parseSyncChangesCursor` uses it in place of the prefix regex and `Date.parse`. The old
  `LEGACY_CURSOR_TIMESTAMP_PATTERN` is gone. The discriminated union and the fixed
  "Invalid sync cursor" message are unchanged.
- `api/src/surveys/list-cursor.ts`: `ListCursor`, `LIST_LIMIT_MAX = 100`, `encodeListCursor`,
  `decodeListCursor(raw, { idPattern? })` and `parseListLimit(raw)`, following the contract in
  the plan. The decoder rejects:
  - a missing `v1:` prefix;
  - an empty body, a body over 512 characters, or one with characters outside base64url;
  - a non-canonical body, such as padding or altered trailing bits;
  - non-JSON content, a non-object, or keys other than exactly `t` and `i`;
  - a non-string `t` or `i`, a non-strict timestamp, or an id that fails the pattern.

  Every failure throws `BadRequestException("Invalid cursor")`, and the unit tests check that the
  input is never echoed. `parseListLimit` returns null for absent or empty input. Otherwise it
  accepts only `^\d{1,3}$` in the range 1..100 and throws "Invalid limit" for anything else.

### Task 2: 22007/22008 backstop and E2E proof (commit 4075b45)
- In `resolveSyncChangesStart`, a try/catch wraps only the legacy translation query. A pg error
  with code 22007, 22008 or 22009 becomes `badRequest("Invalid sync cursor")`. Anything else,
  including a 57014 statement timeout and plain Errors, is rethrown unchanged. The comment cites
  D-12 and the 01.6 todo.
- Unit tests: 22008, 22007 and 22009 each map to 400, and the feed query is never reached.
  57014 and a plain Error propagate as the same object.
- E2E (`describe("malformed legacy cursors")` in `sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts`):
  - `2024-02-30T00:00:00Z|x` gets 400 "Invalid sync cursor", with no echo;
  - `2024-01-01 12:00:00 junk|x` gets 400;
  - a real `created_at::text|id` cursor gets 200 with a `v2:` cursor_out.

## Verification

- Unit (`npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`): 19 suites, 400 tests passed, all green.
  After the extra canonical-body case, list-cursor.ts has 100% coverage. surveys-sync.service.ts
  has 92% line coverage.
- Full E2E on `ibp_p17_02_test` (under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`): 18 suites, 119 passed and
  3 skipped (122 total). The skips were already there.
- Targeted E2E `sync-changes-ordering`: 7 of 7 passed.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check` and `prettier --check` on the
  changed files all pass.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Correctness] Offset range and year 0 in isStrictTimestamp**
- **Found during:** Task 1
- **Issue:** on PG 16, `'2024-01-01 00:00:00+16'::timestamptz` raises 22009 ("time zone
  displacement out of range") and `'0000-01-01 ...'` raises 22008. The plan's regex alone lets
  both through.
- **Fix:** `isStrictTimestamp` rejects offset hours above 15, offset minutes above 59, and
  year 0. It uses `setUTCFullYear` so that years 1..99 round-trip literally, which `Date.UTC`
  would not do.
- **Files:** api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts, api/test/surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts
- **Commit:** 8054341

**2. [Rule 2 - Correctness] Backstop also maps 22009**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** the same `$2::timestamptz` cast raises 22009 on a bad offset, and 22009 is a
  client-input error of the same kind as 22007/22008.
- **Fix:** 22009 is added to the mapped set, with a unit test.
- **Files:** api/src/surveys/surveys-sync.service.ts, api/test/surveys-sync.service.spec.ts
- **Commit:** 4075b45

**3. [Coverage] Extra test commit for the canonical base64url check**
- The first spec never reached the canonical re-encoding branch, because a padded body fails
  the alphabet check first. A `v1:QR` case now covers it.
- **Commit:** 19f42a6 (test only; a third commit alongside the two task commits)

## Known Stubs

None. `list-cursor.ts` has no callers yet by design; plan 11 wires it into the three list
endpoints.

## Threat Flags

None. The change only narrows the input accepted at an existing boundary (T-01.7-05, T-01.7-06
and T-01.7-08 mitigated; T-01.7-07 is completed by plan 11's parameter binding).
