# Phase 01.7 Plan 10: PublicMapService and the EXPLAIN evidence Summary

**The two public map routes now live in `PublicMapService` and use the phase's partial index and generated centroid columns. At 10 000 seeded surveys, map items goes from 20.5 ms to 4.6 ms and the bbox parcel status from 17.8 ms to 1.5 ms. Neither rewritten query scans surveys, parcels or survey_parcels sequentially, and both return exactly the pre-01.7 rows. A committed script and an E2E spec reproduce this inside one rolled-back transaction.**

## Accomplishments

- **PublicMapService (D-07):**
  - `getPublicMapItems` and `getPublicParcelStatuses` moved out of `SurveysService`, together with `withStudyStatus`. The zoom gate (< 15 returns no items), the IGN branch and the row mapping are unchanged.
  - `PublicController` injects `PublicMapService` with the same method names, and `SurveysModule` registers it.
  - `surveys.service.ts` went from 1 407 to 1 115 lines.
- **Rewritten queries (D-13), in `public-map.queries.ts`:**
  - **Map items:** a subquery with the partial-index predicate, the optional filters, `ORDER BY s.submitted_at DESC LIMIT 500`. After it, a `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` computes `AVG(p.centroid_lat)` and `AVG(p.centroid_lng)` over the survey's links. The outer query uses the same final order. There is no `GROUP BY s.id`.
  - **Parcel status, bbox:** first, the parcels whose `centroid_lat` / `centroid_lng` fall in the bbox, `ORDER BY parcel_id LIMIT 1000`. Then a `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` gets the latest public survey per parcel, with the pre-01.7 ranking and `LIMIT 1`. The output columns and the parameter order (`$1` year, `$2..$5` bbox) are unchanged.
  - **Parcel status, no bbox:** the same query without the range. It reads the first 1 000 parcels by id.
  - **Studied by communes (IGN path):** the same LATERAL probe, restricted with `p.commune_code = ANY($2::text[])`.
  - Every query keeps `status = 'submitted' AND visibility = 'public' AND deleted_at IS NULL` (T-01.7-42).
- **EXPLAIN script (D-15):** `node api/scripts/explain-public-routes.js`, run after `npm --workspace api run build`.
  - It requires `dist/surveys/public-map.queries.js` and prints "run npm --workspace api run build first" if that file is missing.
  - `assertResettableDatabase` refuses non-`_test` names and `NODE_ENV=production`.
  - In one transaction: `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = 0`, the seed, `ANALYZE`, then 3× `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for each "before (pre-01.7)" and "after" query. It prints the plans and a summary table with the median time and Seq Scan flags, then runs `ROLLBACK`.
  - It checks that the surveys, parcels and link row counts are identical before and after the run.
  - It exports `runExplain(client, queries)`, `seed`, the legacy builders and constants, and has a `require.main === module` guard.
- **Seed:**
  - 200 users.
  - 8 000 parcels in 400 communes with random centroids over mainland France, from a fixed `setseed`, plus 200 parcels with an empty centroid.
  - 10 000 surveys: 4 000 submitted, 2 000 of them public (100 of those soft-deleted), plus 1 000 public drafts. Each has distinct submission times.
  - 20 276 links (1-3 per survey, none for every 97th survey, and a few to the empty-centroid parcels).
  - All seeded keys carry an `explain` marker.
- **EXPLAIN spec:**
  - The seed test also checks that every link points to an existing parcel.
  - The JSON-plan walk finds no `Seq Scan` on the three relations for map items (no filter, region, date range) or for bbox status (year NULL and 2022). The expected indexes are present: `idx_surveys_public_submitted` + `survey_parcels_pkey`, and `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng` + `idx_survey_parcels_parcel_id`.
  - Row parity with the pre-01.7 SQL, in the same order:
    - map items: 4 filter sets;
    - bbox status: 3 bboxes × 2 years, including the whole seeded range, where the LIMIT 1000 decides;
    - no-bbox status: 2 years.
  - The studied-by-communes query matches the plan-09 window query.
  - Finally it runs `runExplain` and checks that the row counts are unchanged.
  - Each hook and test has a 120 s timeout.

## EXPLAIN on 10 000 surveys (PG 16.13, ibp_p17_10_test, bbox 2..3 E / 48..49 N)

| query | variant | execution (ms, median of 3) | seq scan on surveys/parcels/survey_parcels |
|-------|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| /public/map-items | before (pre-01.7) | 20.537 | yes (survey_parcels) |
| /public/map-items | after | 4.573 | no |
| /public/parcels/status?bbox | before (pre-01.7) | 17.787 | yes (parcels, survey_parcels) |
| /public/parcels/status?bbox | after | 1.502 | no |

The script ran once against ibp_p17_10_test after a build. Its full output is in `/tmp/p17-explain-public.txt`.

**Before, map items:**
- An Index Scan on `idx_surveys_public_submitted` returns all 1 907 live public surveys.
- A Hash Right Join with a **Seq Scan on survey_parcels** (20 276 rows) follows.
- A HashAggregate over 1 907 groups runs, then a top-N sort.

**After, map items:**
- `Limit` over the Index Scan on `idx_surveys_public_submitted` (500 rows).
- A per-row Aggregate over an Index Only Scan on `survey_parcels_pkey` plus an Index Scan on `parcels_parcel_id_key`.

**Before, bbox status:**
- A **Seq Scan on parcels** with four JSON casts in the filter (8 497 rows removed).
- A WindowAgg over every public survey, fed by a **Seq Scan on survey_parcels**.

**After, bbox status:**
- A Bitmap Index Scan on `idx_parcels_centroid_lat_lng`, then a sort and `Limit`.
- A per-parcel `Limit 1` over a Bitmap Index Scan on `idx_survey_parcels_parcel_id` and an Index Scan on `surveys_pkey`.

The "before" rows run the pre-01.7 SQL on the migrated schema, so the old map-items query already benefits from the partial index. That is the RESEARCH "index only" column: 18.9 ms there, 20.5 ms here. RESEARCH measured 23.6 ms for the fully pre-phase state, without migration 015.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: PublicMapService with the rewritten queries:** `bd4a7de` (feat).
2. **Task 2: EXPLAIN script and the no-seq-scan, same-rows spec on 10 000 surveys:** `a0cefc6` (test).

There is one commit per task at the orchestrator's request, so there is no separate RED commit. The unit spec was written against the new modules before the service existed.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 27 suites, 598/598 passed, all thresholds met. `public-map.service.ts` and `public-map.queries.ts` are at 100 %. `src/surveys` is at 75.8 % statements, 61.6 % branches, 75.71 % functions and 76.61 % lines.
- Full E2E, local mode, `ibp_p17_10_test`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` unset, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`: 22 suites, 146 passed, 3 skipped (the MinIO-only cases), 149 total.
- Full E2E, MinIO mode (container `p17-10-minio` on port 19400, the pinned `pgsty/minio` digest from ci.yml, removed afterwards): 22 suites, 148 passed, 1 skipped, 149 total.
- Targeted runs:
  - `surveys-idempotency`: 21/21, with the public map cases unchanged.
  - `public-routes-explain`: 8/8, in about 9 s.
- The script refuses `POSTGRES_DB=ibp` with exit 1, refuses `NODE_ENV=production` with exit 1, and prints the build hint when `dist` is missing. Row counts before and after the run: `{"surveys":294,"parcels":375,"links":482}` both times.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` are clean, and `prettier --check` on the changed `.ts` files is clean.
- Acceptance greps on `public-map.queries.ts`:
  - `LATERAL`: 9.
  - `centroid_lat|centroid_lng`: 8.
  - `centroid ->> 'lat'`: 0.
- `getPublicMapItems|getPublicParcelStatuses` in `surveys.service.ts`: 0.
- `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = 0`: one in the script, one in the spec.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed / adjusted

**1. [Rule 1 - Correctness] `LEFT JOIN LATERAL` for parcel status, not `JOIN LATERAL`**
- **Found during:** Task 1
- **Issue:** The interfaces block writes `JOIN LATERAL (…) latest ON true`. The pre-01.7 query LEFT JOINed `latest_public`, so parcels without a public survey are returned as `not_studied`. An inner join would drop them.
- **Fix:** `LEFT JOIN LATERAL`, as the RESEARCH benchmark SQL does. The studied-by-communes query keeps the inner join because it only lists studied parcels. Parity is proven by the spec.
- **Commit:** bd4a7de

**2. [Rule 2 - Correctness] The no-bbox database path has its own query**
- **Issue:** The plan only names the bbox constant, but `bbox` is optional and the pre-01.7 query then returned the first 1 000 parcels.
- **Fix:** `PUBLIC_PARCEL_STATUSES_SQL`, which has the same LATERAL probe and no range. A spec proves row parity with the legacy query for this path too.
- **Commit:** bd4a7de

**3. [Rule 3 - Blocking] The EXPLAIN seed rounds centroids to 6 decimals**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** With raw `random()` centroids, the bbox query returned 32 rows where the legacy query returned 80. Migration 015's regex (`[0-9]{1,15}` decimals) turns a centroid with 16 or 17 decimals into NULL.
- **Fix:** The seed uses `round(…::numeric, 6)`. That is what the API always writes: `toFixed(6)` in both CadastreProviderService paths, or `{}` for parcels registered by id.
- **Commit:** a0cefc6

**4. [Rule 1 - Bug] Seed statements use plain joins, not scalar subqueries over a CTE**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** The spec's second seeding (inside `runExplain`) ran for more than 120 s. The array CTE was inlined into a per-row scalar subquery and re-aggregated for every one of the 20 000 links. The planner chose that plan because the first run's ANALYZE had updated `pg_class.reltuples`, and that in-place update survives ROLLBACK.
- **Fix:** Users are joined on their seeded email, and parcel ids are computed from their seed index. This also fixed links that pointed at non-existent empty-centroid parcels, which the seed test now checks.
- **Commit:** a0cefc6

**5. SurveysService drops its CadastreProviderService constructor parameter**
- **Issue:** Nothing else in SurveysService used it after the move.
- **Fix:** Removed. No test builds SurveysService by hand.
- **Commit:** bd4a7de

**6. Additional spec coverage**
- The spec also compares the no-bbox path and the commune-scoped studied query (against the plan-09 window SQL), and checks the expected index names, not only the absence of seq scans.

## Behaviour notes

- A parcel whose centroid is not a number, is out of range, or has more than 15 decimals now has NULL generated columns. It falls outside every bbox and adds nothing to the map-items average. Before 01.7, a non-numeric centroid made the whole bbox query fail with a cast error, and an out-of-range one was included.
- `ANALYZE` inside the rolled-back transaction: the `pg_statistic` rows are rolled back, but `pg_class.reltuples` / `relpages` are updated in place and are not. Other specs' results are unaffected, and only the planner's size estimates change until the next autovacuum/analyze.

## Issues Encountered / Findings for the owner

- **Migration 015 precision limit (plan 03, not changed here):** the generated-column regex accepts at most 15 decimal digits. Every centroid the current API writes has 6. Rows written by other means with full double precision (e.g. `2.3522219999999997`, 16 decimals) would get NULL columns and silently drop out of the public bbox and map-items averages. Since 015 is not deployed yet (main has no 01.7 commits), widening the fractional part to `[0-9]+` is safe to do in place. The integer part `{1,3}` already rules out overflow. Worth a quick check of production `parcels.centroid` before deploy: `SELECT count(*) FROM parcels WHERE centroid <> '{}' AND centroid_lat IS NULL`.
- The worktree had no `node_modules`. The root, api and mobile `node_modules` are symlinked from `/home/user/cortege` (untracked, not committed).
- E2E runs used the scratchpad wrapper `p17-10-e2e.sh`. It sources `e2e-env.sh` with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p17_10_test`, unsets `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, uses `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p17-10`, adds the MinIO variables in minio mode, and runs under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. There is no new route or trust boundary. The threats are mitigated as planned:
- **T-01.7-41:** no seq scan at 10k, asserted by the spec.
- **T-01.7-42:** the public predicate is in every query, and rows equal the pre-01.7 queries over seeded private, draft and soft-deleted public surveys.
- **T-01.7-43:** `assertResettableDatabase` is enforced, the seed always rolls back, and the counts are checked.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 11 can add the paginated list queries to `buildCases` in the script and to the spec. `seed(client)` is reusable. It does not seed `survey_events`, so plan 11 adds those.
