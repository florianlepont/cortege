# Phase 01.7 Plan 11: Keyset pagination on the three lists Summary

**`GET /v1/surveys`, `GET /v1/surveys/:id/events` and `GET /v1/reports` now accept optional `limit` (1..100) and `cursor` parameters and page by keyset with plan 02's strict `v1:` cursor. Without `limit` they return every row, in the same order plus a deterministic tiebreaker, with `next_cursor: null`. Adding the list queries to the EXPLAIN run exposed a pre-existing bug: the `ORDER BY` sorted the `::text` output columns. With it fixed, all eight paginated plans on the 10 000-survey seed are index scans that take 0.04 to 0.11 ms. Before the fix, the reports plans were a Seq Scan plus a full sort (12.4 ms).**

## Accomplishments

- **Builders (D-11), pure and exported:**
  - `buildListForUserQuery(userId, filters, page)` in `surveys.repository.ts`, plus `SurveysRepository.listForUser(db, ...)`. The SQL moved out of `SurveysService.listForUser`, which now delegates to it.
  - `buildEventListQuery(surveyId, page)` in `survey-events.service.ts`. It selects `seq::text` for the cursor, and the service strips it, so the item keys are unchanged.
  - `buildReportListQuery(status, page)` in `reports.service.ts`.
  - The keyset predicate always comes after the scope predicate:
    - `user_id = $1` for surveys;
    - the ownership check followed by `survey_id = $1` for events;
    - the reviewer-role check before the query for reports.
  - The cursor fields and `limit + 1` are always bound parameters.
- **Paging rule:** `toListPage` (surveys, events) and the inline equivalent in `listReports` (which calls `encodeListCursor` directly):
  - limit null: every row, `next_cursor` null;
  - limit n: fetch n + 1 rows; if n + 1 came back, drop the extra and mint `next_cursor` from the n-th row.
  - A cursor without a limit applies the keyset with no LIMIT.
- **Controllers (D-18 / C-4):** `@Query("limit")` and `@Query("cursor")` are individual strings, parsed with `parseListLimit` and `decodeListCursor`. There is no class DTO, so unknown parameters are still ignored (proven with `?foo=bar`). The reports cursor uses a UUID id pattern. Events use `decodeEventListCursor`: `^\d{1,19}$` plus a bigint range check. The events route keeps `SafeIdPipe`.
- **Responses:**
  - `GET /surveys` already had `next_cursor: null`.
  - `GET /surveys/:id/events` and `GET /reports` gain the additive `next_cursor` key.
- **EXPLAIN (D-15):**
  - The seed adds 30 000 survey events, 1 003 of them on `explain-s1` (ten per second, so the seq tiebreaker matters).
  - It also adds 20 000 reports over 20 days, 1 in 20 open.
  - The surveys seed now gives every 10th survey to `explain-u1`, 1 000 surveys in all. It is still in the same rolled-back transaction under `SET LOCAL statement_timeout = 0`, with plain joins.
  - `buildListCases` builds the first page (limit 50) and the page after row 500 for each list with the API's own builders. It reads the middle cursor from the unpaginated query.
  - The script loads the three builders from `dist/` and keeps the "run the build first" error.
  - The row-count check now includes `survey_events` and `reports`.
- **API contract:** a new "List pagination (`limit`, `cursor`)" section covers:
  - unpaginated behaviour unchanged;
  - the opaque cursor;
  - `400 Invalid limit` and `400 Invalid cursor`, never echoed;
  - scope on replay;
  - unknown parameters still ignored.

  The three route sections link to it and give the order. The events and reports examples show `next_cursor`, and reports now has a response example.

Plans after the fix:
- **Surveys:** `Limit`, then `Incremental Sort` (presorted `updated_at`), then Index Scan on `idx_surveys_user_updated`. The middle page adds the index condition `updated_at <= $t`.
- **Events:** the same shape on `idx_survey_events_survey`, with `created_at <= $t` on the middle page.
- **Reports, unfiltered:** `Limit` over an Index Scan on `idx_reports_created_id`. The row comparison is itself the index condition, so no sort is needed.
- **Reports, `status=open`:** `Limit`, then `Incremental Sort`, then Index Scan on `idx_reports_status_created`, with `status = 'open' AND created_at <= $t`.

The first run of the script, before the ORDER BY fix, measured:
- surveys: 1.14 / 0.70 ms, a Bitmap Heap Scan and a top-N sort over all of the user's rows;
- events: 0.77 / 0.43 ms, a sort key of `created_at::text DESC, seq::text DESC`;
- reports: 12.4 / 12.8 ms, a **Seq Scan on reports** plus a sort;
- reports `status=open` (with the 75 % open seed used then): 11.0 / 10.7 ms, a **Seq Scan**.

The public map rows were not changed by this plan. The "before" map-items row now also scans parcels sequentially: the changed seed moves the planner's estimates.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1, keyset pagination on the three lists and the pagination E2E:** `8aed63c` (feat). The E2E was written first and ran red: 14 of 17 failed against the old code.
2. **Task 2, EXPLAIN coverage, API contract, and the ORDER BY fix:** `f3a17c2` (feat).

There is one commit per task at the orchestrator's request, so there is no separate RED commit.

## Verification

- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 28 suites, 616/616 passed, all thresholds met.
  - `src/reports`: 61.68 % statements, 59.4 % lines.
  - `src/surveys`: 77.82 % statements.
- Full E2E, local mode, `ibp_p17_11_test`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` unset, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`: 23 suites, 166 passed, 3 skipped (the MinIO-only cases), 169 total.
- Full E2E, MinIO mode: 23 suites, 168 passed, 1 skipped, 169 total. It used container `p17-11-minio` on port 19500 with the pinned `pgsty/minio` digest from ci.yml, removed afterwards.
- Targeted runs:
  - `list-pagination|surveys-idempotency|validation-reports|epic-e`: 4 suites, 50/50.
  - `public-routes-explain|list-pagination`: 28/28.
- `list-pagination.e2e-spec.ts` covers all three lists with 17 cases:
  - no params, compared deep-equal with a direct SQL read and checked for exact item keys;
  - `?foo=bar`;
  - `limit=3` page walks, with and without `status` / `q` filters;
  - `limit` 0 / 101 / abc;
  - a `garbage` cursor and a Feb-30 cursor, with no echo;
  - wrong-pattern ids;
  - user A's cursor replayed by user B (surveys: only B's rows; events: 404; reports: 403);
  - a cursor without a limit;
  - the bigint seq tiebreaker (seq 10000000000 before 9000000000 at the same `created_at`).
- The `public-routes-explain` spec's new tests:
  - seed counts;
  - for all 8 list plans: no Seq Scan on the five watched relations, no plain `Sort` node, `Limit` at the root, and exactly the expected index;
  - each page's rows equal `slice(start, start + limit + 1)` of the unpaginated order;
  - `runExplain` lists the 12 cases and reports no seq scan outside the "before" rows.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` are clean. `prettier --check` is clean on the changed `.ts` files.
- Acceptance greps:
  - `@Query("cursor")`: 2 in surveys.controller.ts, 1 in reports.controller.ts.
  - No `QueryDto` class.
  - `grep -c "Invalid limit" docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md`: 1.
  - `cursor` in the contract: 8 before, 27 after.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] ORDER BY sorted the `::text` output columns, not the timestamps or the bigint seq**
- **Found during:** Task 2, on the first EXPLAIN run.
- **Issue:**
  - All three list queries select `created_at::text` or `updated_at::text` (and now `seq::text`) under the column's own name.
  - PostgreSQL resolves an unqualified ORDER BY name to the output column first, so the lists sorted by text: the plan showed `Sort Key: ((created_at)::text) DESC, ((seq)::text) DESC`.
  - For events, seq then sorts lexicographically ("590" > "1000"), out of step with the `(created_at, seq) < (...)::bigint` keyset, which would skip or repeat events across pages.
  - No index could serve the order, which is why reports did a Seq Scan and a sort (12.4 ms).
  - The same text ordering existed before this phase for timestamps. The session time zone is fixed and the database collation is C.UTF-8 here, so the text order matched the timestamp order in practice.
- **Fix:**
  - `ORDER BY surveys.updated_at DESC, surveys.id DESC`, `survey_events.created_at DESC, survey_events.seq DESC` and `reports.created_at DESC, reports.id DESC`, with a comment on each.
  - A new E2E fixture: two events at the same second with seq 9000000000 and 10000000000.
- **Plan grep impact:** the acceptance greps `ORDER BY updated_at DESC, id DESC` and `created_at DESC, seq DESC` now match only in their qualified spelling.
- **Commit:** f3a17c2

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] reports.id is TEXT, not uuid**
- **Issue:** the interfaces block writes `$m::uuid`, but migration 007 declares `reports.id TEXT`. A uuid cast would compare uuid against text (a type error), and ordering by text id must use the text comparison.
- **Fix:** `(created_at, id) < ($n::timestamptz, $m)`. The cursor id is still required to match a UUID pattern (every report id is `randomUUID()`).
- **Commit:** 8aed63c

**3. [Rule 2 - Correctness] Events cursor id bounded to the bigint range**
- **Issue:** `^\d{1,19}$` accepts `9999999999999999999`, which fails the `$3::bigint` cast (22003) and would answer 500.
- **Fix:** `decodeEventListCursor` adds `BigInt(i) <= 9223372036854775807`, with a unit test.
- **Commit:** 8aed63c

**4. [Rule 3 - Blocking] The unit test for listForSurvey and a new unit spec (files outside files_modified)**
- `api/test/survey-events.service.spec.ts` asserted the old `{ items }` response and SQL. It now expects `next_cursor: null` and the new ORDER BY, and checks that there is no LIMIT when unpaginated.
- `api/test/list-pagination.spec.ts` (new, 18 tests) covers the builders, `toListPage`, `decodeEventListCursor` and `ReportsService.listReports`. Without it the `./src/reports/` coverage ratchet failed (34.78 % statements against a floor of 36 %).
- **Commits:** 8aed63c, f3a17c2

**5. EXPLAIN seed: reports 1 in 20 open, not a 3 in 4 mix**
- **Issue:** with 75 % open, the planner rightly served `status=open` from `idx_reports_created_id` plus a filter (0.05 ms), so the plan's expected `idx_reports_status_created` never appeared.
- **Fix:** open reports are a moderation queue (1 000 of 20 000). The filtered plan then uses `idx_reports_status_created` with an Incremental Sort, as the plan intends. Both plans are index-driven either way.
- **Commit:** f3a17c2

**6. Seed distribution of surveys over users**
- Every 10th seeded survey now belongs to `explain-u1`, so one user has 1 000 surveys (the plan asks for a middle page at row 500 for "one busy user"). Before, each user had 50. The plan-10 assertions do not depend on the owner and still pass.

### Formatting note

`api/scripts/explain-public-routes.js` is outside `format:check`, and its existing style is single quotes with semicolons. It was formatted with `--single-quote --trailing-comma es5 --print-width 100`, and the two pre-existing over-long lines were kept as they were, so the diff shows only this plan's changes.

## Findings for the owner

- `SurveysAttachmentsService` (`surveys-attachments.service.ts:313-316`) has the same pattern: `created_at::text` selected and `ORDER BY created_at DESC`, so attachments sort by text. This plan did not change it. The fix is to write `ORDER BY attachments.created_at DESC`.
- Sequence values consumed inside the rolled-back EXPLAIN transaction are not returned: each run advances `survey_events.seq` by 30 000. This is harmless, since seq only needs to be unique and increasing.
- The worktree has `node_modules` symlinks to `/home/user/cortege` (untracked, not committed).
- E2E runs used the scratchpad wrapper `p17-11-e2e.sh`. It sources `e2e-env.sh` with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p17_11_test`, unsets `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, adds the MinIO variables in minio mode, and runs under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. There is no new route. The new query parameters are mitigated as planned:
- **T-01.7-44:** the keyset sits inside the user, ownership or role scope, and the E2E replays A's cursor as B.
- **T-01.7-45:** strict decode, then bound parameters only.
- **T-01.7-46:** limit 1..100 with an n + 1 fetch, the strict timestamp check, the bigint bound, and index-only plans shown by EXPLAIN.
- **T-01.7-47:** no-param responses are deep-equal to the pre-plan SQL, and unknown parameters are still accepted.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: api/test/list-pagination.e2e-spec.ts, api/test/list-pagination.spec.ts, and all modified files on disk.
- FOUND commits: 8aed63c, f3a17c2.
