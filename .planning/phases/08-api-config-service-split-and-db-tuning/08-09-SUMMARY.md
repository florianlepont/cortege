  - "ensureParcelIds inserts rows in parcel_id order, so concurrent registrations of overlapping sets wait in the same order"
  - "One failing tile makes the whole call return null (DB path) with a single warning; tiles that succeeded stay cached"
  - "ensureParcelById is removed: after batching nothing calls it (resolve uses its own upsert, resolveParcelFromCoordinates)"

# Phase 01.7 Plan 09: ParcelsService and the single IGN client Summary

**IGN calls now have one client, CadastreProviderService, and its timeout covers the response body. Map requests are served per z15 tile from a bounded 24 h LRU cache, a bbox wider than 16 tiles never reaches IGN, and at most 4 tiles are fetched at once. The "studied" ranking only covers the communes of the returned features. Parcel logic lives in ParcelsService, where registering any number of parcel ids takes one statement. A sync create costs the same with 50 parcels as with 1.**

## Accomplishments

- **Full timeout (D-08, T-01.7-35):**
  - `fetchJson` uses `signal: AbortSignal.timeout(this.timeoutMs)` and `return await response.json()`.
  - Geocodage, API Carto and the WFS share it.
  - A local server that sends headers and then stalls is aborted after about 200 ms on both the WFS path and the geocodage path. Geocodage still falls back to the synthetic parcel.
- **Tile cache and fan-out cap (D-08, T-01.7-36/37/38):**
  - `fetchParcelFeaturesInBbox` snaps the bbox to z15 Web Mercator tiles and fetches each missing tile once, using the tile bounds (6 decimals, EPSG:4326) and `count` wfsCount.
  - Parsed features are cached in `new LRUCache({ max: 256, maxSize: 64 MB, sizeCalculation: JSON length, ttl: 24 h })`. An empty tile is cached; a failed tile is not.
  - Results are de-duplicated across tiles and filtered to the features whose geometry bounds intersect the request bbox.
  - More than 16 tiles returns null before any call is made. At most 4 tiles are in flight at once.
  - `WfsParcelFeature` has no study fields.
- **Failures are visible (T-01.7-40):** the silent `catch { return [] }` is gone. Every failure logs `IGN WFS failed: <message>` once and returns null, so the caller uses the DB path.
- **Commune-scoped studied query (T-01.7-39):**
  - `withStudyStatus` ranks only surveys on parcels with `p.commune_code = ANY($2::text[])`, using the distinct commune codes of the features.
  - Ranking, year filter and output mapping are unchanged.
  - Features match parcels only on their exact commune code, so the result is the same as before.
- **ParcelsService (D-07/D-10):**
  - `ensureParcelIds`: one `INSERT … SELECT … FROM unnest($1::uuid[], $2::text[], …) ON CONFLICT (parcel_id) DO NOTHING`. It keeps the old normalisation and de-duplication, returns ids in input order, and fills the same placeholder fields as the old single-id path.
  - `validateParcelSubmit`: one `GROUP BY p.parcel_id` query. The outcomes are the same: `parcel_required`, `parcel_invalid`, and a conflict on the first mismatching parcel in survey order.
  - `displayLocation`: one query over `centroid_lat`/`centroid_lng`. It uses the linked-parcel average first, then the legacy `parcel_id` centroid, then null.
- **Controllers, module and SurveysService:**
  - `ParcelsController` injects `ParcelsService`, with the same routes and the same responses.
  - `SurveysModule` registers `ParcelsService`.
  - `submitSurvey`'s sorted `FOR UPDATE` block is byte-identical (01.4 D-08).
- **Size:** `surveys.service.ts` went from 1 835 to 1 407 lines. `parcels.service.ts` is 359 lines.

## Query budget (D-09 / D-10)

| Case | Before 01.7 (BASELINE) | After this plan |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|
| 100 creates, 1 parcel each | 1 001 | 901 |
| 100 updates (v2), same 1 parcel | 901 | 901 |
| 100 creates, 3 parcels each | 1 301 | 901 |
| 100 updates (v2), same 3 parcels | 1 101 | 901 |
| 1 create, 1 new parcel | n/a | 10 |
| 1 create, 50 new parcels | n/a | 10 |

The counts are identical in the targeted run and in both full-suite runs, and include the request's one auth lookup. The statement count per op no longer depends on the number of parcels (9 per op). Plan 12's CTE brings it under BASELINE / 3.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: One IGN client with a full timeout, per-tile cache and tile cap:** `ebf9f20` (feat).
   - RED evidence: I temporarily put the old `AbortController` + `clearTimeout` fetchJson back. Both stalled-body cases then failed with "Exceeded timeout of 5000 ms". The fixed version passes them in about 205 ms.
2. **Task 2: ParcelsService with batched writes, and SurveysService on the new client:** `94d60b0` (feat).
3. **Task 3: One-statement proof in the budget spec:** `4a27ce2` (test).

There is one commit per task at the orchestrator's request, so there are no separate `test(...)` RED commits for tasks 1 and 2.

## Verification

- Unit tests:
  - `cadastre-provider` 16/16 (10 new) and `parcels.service` 15/15.
  - `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 24 suites, 544/544, exit 0, all thresholds met.
  - `src/surveys` is at 71.1% statements, 55.3% branches, 67.9% functions and 71.8% lines (floor 56/41/51/56).
- Full E2E, local mode, `ibp_p17_09_test`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` unset, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`: 21 suites, 138 passed, 3 skipped (the MinIO-only cases), 141 total.
- Full E2E, MinIO mode (container `p17-09-minio` on port 19300, pinned `pgsty/minio` digest from ci.yml, removed afterwards): 21 suites, 140 passed, 1 skipped, 141 total.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` are clean. `prettier --check` on the 8 changed files is clean.
- Acceptance greps in `cadastre-provider.service.ts`:
  - `AbortSignal.timeout`: 2.
  - `clearTimeout|new AbortController`: 0.
  - `new LRUCache`: 1.
  - `WFS_MAX_TILES_PER_REQUEST = 16|WFS_TILE_ZOOM = 15`: 2.
- Acceptance greps in `parcels.service.ts`: `unnest(` 1 and `GROUP BY` 2 (one in the query, one in the doc comment).
- Acceptance greps in `surveys.service.ts`:
  - `commune_code = ANY(`: 1.
  - `ignParcelWfs|resolvePublicParcelStatusesFromIgnWfs|private async ensureParcelIds|clearTimeout`: 0.
  - `parcels\.(ensureParcelIds|validateParcelSubmit|displayLocation)\(` matches all three.
- The new code has no `process.env` and no `console`, so it already complies with plan 07's lint rules.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed / adjusted

**1. [Rule 1 - Correctness] `displayLocation` keeps a fallback parcel argument**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** The plan's signature is `displayLocation(db, surveyId)`, but today's semantics fall back to the survey's legacy `parcel_id` centroid, and the plan asks to keep that order.
- **Fix:** `displayLocation(db, surveyId, fallbackParcelId)`. It is still one query, a LEFT JOIN on the fallback parcel.
- **Commit:** 94d60b0

**2. [Rule 2 - Efficiency within D-10] `validateParcelSubmit` receives the parcel ids and absorbs the existence check**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** The old method re-read the survey's parcel ids and ran a separate existence query before the per-parcel loop.
- **Fix:** `submitSurvey` passes the `surveyParcelIds` it already read (same transaction, survey row locked). The single query starts from `parcels` with LEFT JOINs, so a missing parcel shows up as a missing row. The result is one statement instead of 2 + N, with identical outcomes, which are covered by unit and E2E tests. The sorted `FOR UPDATE` lines are untouched; only the call below them changed.
- **Commit:** 94d60b0

**3. [Rule 2 - Concurrency] Batched parcel inserts are sorted by `parcel_id`**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** Two transactions registering overlapping parcel sets in different orders could wait on each other's unique-index entries.
- **Fix:** The insert rows are sorted by `parcel_id`. The output order is still the input order.
- **Commit:** 94d60b0

**4. `ensureParcelById` removed rather than kept**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** The plan lists it as "still used by resolve", but resolve goes through `resolveParcelFromCoordinates`, which has its own upsert. After batching nothing called `ensureParcelById`, and an unused private method fails `noUnusedLocals`.
- **Fix:** Removed.
- **Commit:** 94d60b0

**5. SurveysService drops its ConfigService parameter**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** The WFS fields were the only config it read.
- **Fix:** It now asks `cadastreProvider.wfsEnabled`. No test constructs SurveysService by hand.
- **Commit:** 94d60b0

### Behaviour notes

- A WFS polygon whose coordinates contain no numeric point is now skipped, because it cannot be placed in a bbox. Before, it was forwarded with an empty-looking geometry.
- An IGN failure used to be indistinguishable from "no parcels". Both still fall through to the DB path, but a failure is now logged.

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree had no `node_modules`. The root, api and mobile `node_modules` are symlinked from `/home/user/cortege` (untracked, not committed).
- The E2E runs used the scratchpad wrapper `p09-e2e.sh`. It sources `e2e-env.sh` with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p17_09_test`, unsets `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, uses `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p17-09`, adds the MinIO variables in minio mode, and runs under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. There is no new route or trust boundary. T-01.7-35 to T-01.7-40 are mitigated as planned and covered by unit cases:
- stalled body;
- 17-tile and country-sized bboxes;
- 4-in-flight instrumentation;
- cache bounds as named constants;
- no study fields in the cached type;
- commune-scoped query;
- a single warning on HTTP 500 and on a thrown fetch.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 10 can move `getPublicParcelStatuses` and `withStudyStatus` to `PublicMapService` as they are. The IGN contract is `cadastre.wfsEnabled` plus `fetchParcelFeaturesInBbox(bbox)`.
- Plan 12 can fold `ensureParcelIds`' unnest insert into its create/update CTE.
