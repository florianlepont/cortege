# Phase 01.7 Plan 03: Migration 015, migration lock and query-budget baseline Summary

**Migration 015 adds the partial public-survey index, NULL-safe STORED centroid columns with a btree index, the actor and reports-keyset indexes, and drops three redundant indexes; migrate.js now serialises runs with a session-level advisory lock; the query-budget spec records 1 001 / 901 / 1 301 / 1 101 statements for 100-op sync batches.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** about 35 min
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files:** 4 created, 2 modified

## Accomplishments

- Migration 015 applies cleanly over seeded bad centroids (`"abc"`, `{}`, 95, `"1e400"`, a 400-digit string); only well-formed in-range values survive (`" 48.5 "` -> 48.5), and updates to `centroid` recompute both columns. It is idempotent.
- `scripts/migrate.js` takes `pg_advisory_lock(7017015)` right after connect and releases it in `finally` (unlock errors swallowed). Two concurrent runs on an empty database both succeed, each file is recorded once, and a held lock blocks the runner.
- The D-09 baseline is committed as a spec, before any sync-path change.

## Query-budget baseline (measured on the current code)

| Case | Measured | BASELINE constant |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| 100 creates, 1 parcel each | 1 001 | 1001 |
| 100 updates (v2), same 1 parcel | 901 | 901 |
| 100 creates, 3 parcels each | 1 301 | 1301 |
| 100 updates (v2), same 3 parcels | 1 101 | 1101 |

The counts include the one auth lookup of each request. All four match the RESEARCH baseline exactly, in both the targeted run and the full-suite run. All 100 results were `synced` in every case.

## RED evidence

- `migration-015` spec: 9/9 failed before the migration file existed (ENOENT).
- `migrate-lock` spec on the old runner: all 3 failed. The concurrent case gave `["fulfilled", "rejected"]` with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_class_relname_nsp_index"` (RESEARCH saw the `pg_type_typname_nsp_index` variant of the same race). The holder case resolved before 300 ms because nothing waited on the lock.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Migration 015 with a seeded bad-row test** - `4b05ab2` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Advisory lock in the migration runner** - `814f7eb` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Query-budget spec recording the baseline** - `f04405b` (test)

## Verification

- Targeted: `migration-014` + `migration-015` 15/15; `migrate-lock` 3/3 on three consecutive runs, then 0 `%lock%_test` databases left.
- Full E2E on `ibp_p17_03_test`: 21 suites passed, 132 tests passed, 3 skipped (135 total).
- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 18 suites, 334 tests passed, thresholds met.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`: clean. `prettier --check` on the three new specs: clean.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **[Rule 3 - Blocking] 3-parcel budget batch shares one parcel with the 1-parcel batch.** With three brand-new parcels per op, the 3-parcel create measured 1 401 (14 statements per op: one more parcel SELECT + INSERT pair than the baseline), which failed `count <= 1301`. The 1 301 figure corresponds to one existing parcel plus two new ones per op. The spec now uses parcel ids `QB<run>S<i>K<k>`, so survey i of the 3-parcel set reuses parcel K0 of survey i of the 1-parcel set. With that, the measured counts equal the RESEARCH baseline exactly, and the constant stays as specified. Recorded in a spec comment.
2. **One commit per task instead of separate RED/GREEN commits.** The orchestrator required one commit per task; the RED runs were executed and are recorded above.
3. **`docs/technical/data-contract-v1.md` is not Prettier-clean**, but it was not clean before this plan either and `format:check` covers only `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.json`. I kept the file's existing style.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the deviations above.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plans 09 and 10 can use `idx_surveys_public_submitted`, `centroid_lat`/`centroid_lng` and the budget spec. Plan 11 can use `idx_reports_created_id`. Plan 12 changes the four assertions to `Math.floor(BASELINE[case] / 3)`.
