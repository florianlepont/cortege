# Plan 01.7-14 Summary: PR evidence, owner VPS sitting, deploy checks

Every step is recorded in 08-VALIDATION.md, in the sections "CI Evidence", "Owner visit" and "Post-deploy checks".

## Task 1: PR CI evidence

- PR #156, run 36218885075: every job is green, including the MinIO-mode E2E and the smoke test "production refuses default configuration".

## Task 2: owner sitting on the VPS

- `check-env.sh` reported OK. The two AUTH0_MGMT warnings are not blocking.
- The owner confirmed the MinIO backup is OK.
- PR merged on 2026-09-26 at 07:27 UTC. Main CI run 36226822886 pushed the image at 07:30.
- The deploy recreated MinIO on `pgsty/minio` and recreated the API. The API was healthy after 2 attempts.
- **Deviation:** the owner pasted the step 8 prose line into the shell. It only produced "unit not found" errors and changed nothing; the owner then re-ran the commands one per line.

## Task 3: post-deploy checks

- Health returns 200.
- CORS headers are absent, which is the evidence that the new image is running (`CORS_ORIGIN=none`).
- The public map returns 200.
- Unauthenticated calls return 401.
- MinIO health returns 200.
- The owner ran the centroid NULL-count query on production: 0.
