# Phase 01.7 Plan 07: Config enforcement, deploy guard and dead-variable removal Summary

**ESLint now rejects `process.env` outside `src/config` and `main.ts`, and rejects any `console` in `api/src`. CI proves on the built image that production refuses the dev defaults. `update-stack.sh` checks the configuration of the new image before restarting, retries after a fix and re-executes itself when it changes. `check-env.sh` gives the owner the API's verdict on the VPS env file without Node or Docker. The six dead token variables are gone from examples, CI and docs.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** about 14 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T22:17:39Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T22:32Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 14 (3 created)

## Accomplishments

### Task 1: ESLint enforcement and CI smoke (`ccf5870`)

- `api/.eslintrc.json` adds `no-restricted-properties` (process.env, with the D-01 message) and `no-console` at top level. The rule is off for `src/config/**/*.ts`, `src/main.ts` and `test/**/*.ts`; `no-console` is off for `test/**/*.ts`. `npm run lint` passes with nothing to fix.
- I checked that the rules fire with `eslint --stdin` probes. Under the name `src/app.module.ts`, both rules report. Under `src/config/app-config.ts`, only `no-console` reports. Under `test/config-helper.ts`, nothing reports.
- `ci.yml`: the six dead variables are removed from the e2e job, the e2e-minio job and the health smoke `-e` flags. The new step "Smoke test — production refuses default configuration" follows the health smoke. It overrides the CMD, uses `timeout 60`, and fails on exit code 0 or 124. It then greps `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in the log, requires `check-config.js` to exit 1 on the same env, and requires it to exit 0 on a valid fake production env. The YAML parses with python and actionlint returns 0.
- **Local smoke on a built image.** The image comes from `api/Dockerfile`, with only the proxy CA added to the two `npm ci` layers of a scratch copy (see Deviations):
  - `node api/dist/main.js` with the default env: **exit 1**. The log names POSTGRES_PASSWORD, plus POSTGRES_HOST/PORT/USER/DB, OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT, OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY, AUTH0_DOMAIN, AUTH0_AUDIENCE and CORS_ORIGIN.
  - `node api/dist/config/check-config.js` with the same env: **exit 1**, with 10 ERREUR lines and 2 ATTENTION lines.
  - `node api/dist/config/check-config.js` with a valid production env: **exit 0** (`OK : la configuration de production est valide.` and the two AUTH0_MGMT warnings).

### Task 2: Deploy guard, pre-merge check, specs (`affda56`)

- **update-stack.sh**
  - `SELF` and `self_before` (sha256) are set before the fetch.
  - After `merge --ff-only`, if the hash changed and `CORTEGE_UPDATE_STACK_REEXEC` is unset, the script logs, exports the variable and runs `exec bash "$SELF" "$@"`.
  - After the pull, it reads `running` with `docker inspect --format '{{.Image}}' cortege-api` and skips only when `running = after`. When `before = after` it logs a retry line.
  - It then runs `compose run --rm --no-deps api node api/dist/config/check-config.js`. On failure it logs "configuration check failed; the stack was NOT restarted …" and exits 1.
  - `compose up -d`, the health loop and the prune are unchanged.
  - The check call is on line 68, before `compose up -d` on line 74. The `exec bash` (line 43) comes after the `merge --ff-only` (line 33).
- **check-env.sh** (mode 755)
  - `set -euo pipefail`. A `while read` parser skips blanks and comments, accepts an optional `export `, strips one pair of matching quotes and keeps the last value for a repeated key. There is no source or eval, and the gate grep finds nothing.
  - It applies the rules of `findProductionProblems` to the compose-mapped values: POSTGRES_HOST/PORT and OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE come from compose, and the storage secret comes from MINIO_SECRET_KEY. Default detection covers blank, ibp/minio/minio123 (case-insensitive) and a `change[-_]?me` prefix. The CORS rules are the API's, in the same order.
  - It prints ATTENTION lines for AUTH0_MGMT_* and an INFO "ligne inutile" line for each dead variable present.
  - The last line is `OK : …` or `À corriger avant la fusion : N problème(s).` It never prints a value.
  - On the committed `infra/vps/env.example` it exits 1, naming POSTGRES_PASSWORD and MINIO_SECRET_KEY.
- **Specs** (TDD: both were written first; the RED run gave 36 failed and 3 passed, the latter being cases (c), (f) and (g), which the old script already satisfied):
  - `vps-deploy-guard.spec.ts` covers cases (a) to (g) of the plan, with a stub `git merge` that replaces the script through a new inode, as git does.
  - `check-env-parity.spec.ts` has 25 fixtures, each asserting the same exit status, the same ERREUR variable set as `runConfigCheck(composeMapped(fixture), ["--production"])`, and that no secret leaks. The fixtures include the ones in the plan plus upper-case `IBP`, a blank AUTH0_DOMAIN, `NONE`, an origin list, an origin with a path, a CORS value of only commas, a quoted placeholder, file values the compose block overrides, dead variables, several faults at once and an empty file.
  - The parity spec also has these extra cases: the valid fixture passes both checks; the AUTH0_MGMT warning does not fail the check; dead variables produce INFO lines only; the `bash -s --` pipe form (the owner command) works; a missing file is reported; `$(...)` and backticks in the file are never executed.
  - The last two cases cover `env.example`: as committed, both checks refuse it; with only its CHANGE_ME placeholders replaced, both accept it.
- **infra/vps/README.md**: a new French section, "Vérification de la configuration (avant fusion et à chaque déploiement)". It explains what production refuses, gives the single owner command (`git fetch … && git show origin/<branche>:infra/vps/check-env.sh | bash -s -- /home/ubuntu/cortege.env`), and describes the guard: the old stack keeps serving, the journal shows the refusal (`journalctl -u cortege-deploy -n 50`), the next run retries automatically, and the script re-executes itself when it changes. It ends with the subsection "Premier déploiement de la phase 01.7", which gives the 8-step D-21 sequence and why it is needed once.

### Task 3: Examples and docs (`900b0ff`)

- The six dead variables and their comments are removed from `api/.env.example`, `api/.env.production.example`, `infra/.env.example` and `infra/vps/env.example`.
- `CORS_ORIGIN=none` is set in both production examples, with the French comment from the plan. The dev examples are unchanged.
- The optional `PG_*` and `AUTH0_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` lines, commented out with their defaults (10, 30000, 5000, 10000, 60000, 5000), are added to `api/.env.example` and `infra/vps/env.example`, and also to `api/.env.production.example`.
- In CLAUDE.md and README.md, the JWT secrets row is removed, the CORS row now carries the production rule, and a pool/timeout row is added. CLAUDE.md CI/CD gains one line about the configuration check. In api/README.md, the sentence about `email_change_token_dev` is removed: the feature no longer exists in `api/src`, so dropping only the variable mention would have left a false statement.

## Verification

- `npm run lint`: exit 0, with the new rules active (`no-restricted-properties` appears twice in api/.eslintrc.json).
- `npm run typecheck`: exit 0.
- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: **23 suites, 544 tests passed**, thresholds met. The two new suites have 40 tests (7 guard, 33 parity).
- **Full E2E**:
  - Setup: `ibp_p17_07_test`, OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=local. The wrapper unsets ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and the other five dead variables and prints `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET is unset`. The run was under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`.
  - Result: **21 suites passed, 137 passed, 3 skipped (the existing MinIO-only cases), 140 total**.
- `npm run format:check`: all matched files use Prettier style. `prettier --check` on the changed TS and JSON files passes.
- The CI YAML parses with python `yaml.safe_load`, and `/tmp/actionlint-bin/actionlint` returns 0.
- Acceptance greps:
  - the check-config call appears once in update-stack.sh, before `up -d`;
  - `NOT restarted` appears once;
  - `CORTEGE_UPDATE_STACK_REEXEC` appears 2 times;
  - `systemctl stop cortege-deploy.timer` appears 5 times in the VPS README and `check-env.sh` 4 times;
  - `^CORS_ORIGIN=none` is in both production examples;
  - `PG_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` appears once in CLAUDE.md.
- Dead-variable grep gate: one hit remains, `api/src/config/env.schema.ts:14` (a comment; see Deviations 1).

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Out of scope, recorded] `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` and `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` remain in one comment in `api/src/config/env.schema.ts:14`**
- That doc comment from plan 01 lists the variables deliberately left out of the schema (D-04).
- The file is not in this plan's `files_modified`, so I left it unchanged, as instructed. As a result, the dead-variable grep gate returns exactly that line. No code, example, CI job or doc reads or sets these variables.
- Fix for whoever owns the file next (01.9 docs sweep or a later config plan): reword it to "the removed token secrets, their lifetimes and the AUTH_* switches are deliberately absent (D-04)".

**2. [Out of scope, recorded] One comment in `api/src/app.module.ts:37` contains the text `process.env`**
- The comment reads "(src/config), never process.env directly (D-01)". The plan's Task 1 verify line (`grep 'process\.env' api/src | grep -v config | grep -v main.ts | wc -l = 0`) therefore returns 1.
- ESLint, which checks code rather than text, passes. The file is not in `files_modified` and belongs to plan 05 or 08's area, so I left it unchanged.

**3. [Rule 3 - Blocking] The `CORS_ORIGIN=none` line of `infra/vps/env.example` moved from Task 3 to Task 2**
- Task 2's parity spec asserts that env.example, with only its placeholders replaced, passes. That assertion needs `CORS_ORIGIN=none`.
- I made that single edit in the Task 2 commit, so every commit is green. The rest of the env.example changes landed in Task 3.

**4. [Rule 3 - Blocking] VPS README wording changed in Task 3**
- My first draft of the README section listed the six dead variable names. The grep gate (which excludes only check-env.sh and its spec) caught them.
- Task 3 reworded the sentence to describe the lines without naming them.

**5. [Environment] Local image build**
- Docker Hub answered 429 for `node:22-alpine`, so I pulled `mirror.gcr.io/library/node:22-alpine` and tagged it `node:22-alpine`.
- Containers cannot use the sandbox proxy's CA. The build therefore used a scratch copy of `api/Dockerfile` that only adds `COPY --from=ca ca-bundle.crt` and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`/`npm_config_cafile` to the two `npm ci` layers, built with `--network host`, a proxy build-arg and `--build-context ca=/root/.ccr`. The committed Dockerfile is unchanged.
- The image was tagged `cortege:p17-07`, and the containers were named `p1707-smoke-a/b/c`.

**6. [Additions to the specs] Extra spec cases beyond the plan's list**
- Added cases: `bash -s` pipe form, no execution of `$(...)` or backticks, a missing file, the INFO line for dead variables, and more CORS and default fixtures. They strengthen the T-01.7-27 and T-01.7-28 mitigations and change no behaviour.

**Total deviations:** 2 recorded out of scope (comments in files owned by other plans), 2 blocking fixes (task ordering and gate wording), 1 environment workaround.

## Issues Encountered

- Prettier `--check` also flags `ci.yml`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` and `api/README.md`. They are already flagged at the base commit `6d7f488`, and the project's `format:check` covers only `ts`, `tsx` and `json`, which pass. I did not reformat them, so the diffs stay limited to the planned rows.

## TDD Gate Compliance

Task 2 (`tdd="true"`): I wrote both specs first and ran them red (36 failed and 3 passed; the passing cases (c), (f) and (g) describe behaviour the old script already had). I then implemented until they were green (40 passed). The orchestrator asked for one commit per task, so RED and GREEN are in the single commit `affda56` rather than separate `test(...)` and `feat(...)` commits.

## Threat Flags

None. `check-env.sh` only reads a local file and prints variable names. The deploy guard only adds a `compose run` of the image the stack already trusts.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 14's owner checklist can reuse the README commands as written: check-env through `git show … | bash -s`, then the 8-step first-deploy sequence.
- The 01.9 docs sweep should reword the comment in `env.schema.ts:14` (Deviation 1) and, if the text grep matters, the comment in `app.module.ts:37` (Deviation 2).

## Self-Check: PASSED
