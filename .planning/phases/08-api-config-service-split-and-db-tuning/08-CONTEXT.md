# Phase 01.7: API configuration, service split and database tuning - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-09-25
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Owner answers during `/gsd:plan-phase 1.7` after research, plus Claude's technical decisions. This file overrides 08-RESEARCH.md wherever the two differ.

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

This phase covers audit lots L14, L15 and the remainder of L16:

- **Validated configuration.** The API reads its configuration through `@nestjs/config` and checks it against a schema at startup. In production it refuses to start on bad or default settings.
- **Database pool and logging.** The `pg` pool is bounded and has an error listener. The API logs only through the Nest Logger, and failed authentications are logged without leaking details.
- **`SurveysService` split.** It becomes a repository plus survey, events, parcels and public-map services, and the duplicated helpers are removed.
- **Fewer queries per sync.** A 100-operation sync batch issues at least three times fewer queries than today. The three list endpoints get cursor pagination.
- **IGN fetch.** Fully timed out and cached per tile.
- **Database changes.** Migration 015 adds the public-surveys index and the generated centroid columns, the migration runner takes an advisory lock, and a safety drop removes `auth_sessions`.

Two items carried in from STATE.md:

- **Legacy cursor bug.** A malformed legacy sync cursor currently returns 500; it must return 400.
- **MinIO image.** The local and VPS compose files move to the pinned `pgsty/minio` image.

Installed mobile apps must keep working without an update. Every API response shape stays the same, and every new parameter is optional.

## Implementation Decisions

### Configuration (REQ-AUD-config)

- **D-01: Config library and validation.**
  - `@nestjs/config` pinned to **4.0.4**. 12.x is ESM-only and the API is CommonJS under Jest 29.
  - The `validate` hook uses class-validator, which is already installed. No Joi and no zod.
  - `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true, validate })`. Every `process.env` read under `api/src` moves behind `ConfigService` or a typed config provider. Exception: code that must run before Nest boots, such as `scripts/migrate.js` and the test-env loader.
- **D-02: Production rules (`NODE_ENV=production`). Startup refuses when:**
  - a Postgres password or MinIO/S3 secret equals a known default (`ibp`, `minio`, `minio123`, `change-me`, or empty);
  - `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` or `AUTH0_DOMAIN` is empty;
  - `CORS_ORIGIN` is missing or empty.
  - Also: `AUTH0_MGMT_*` missing produces a warning only; the feature degrades as it does today. Outside production, defaults stay allowed so local dev and tests are unchanged.
- **D-03 (owner): CORS in production is `CORS_ORIGIN=none`.**
  - `none` means CORS disabled: no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for any browser origin.
  - An explicit URL, or a comma-separated list, is also accepted.
  - Empty or missing refuses startup in production. The mobile app does not need CORS.
- **D-04: Secrets.**
  - `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` and the two unused `AUTH_*` flags are removed from code, env examples, CI, docs and CLAUDE.md.
  - `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` is also removed. The HS256 test path and `POST /debug/test-token` both use a random secret generated once per process, and only when `NODE_ENV=test`.
  - The E2E suites and the owner-check simulation keep working unchanged, because they get their token from the same process.
- **D-05 (owner): pre-flight check before deploy.**
  - A script (`api/scripts/check-config.js`, or `node api/dist/config/check.js`) runs the same validation outside Nest and prints what is missing, in plain words.
  - The owner runs one command on the VPS before merging: `docker compose … run --rm api node …check…` against `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env`, or the equivalent the planner finds workable with the pull-based stack.
  - A CI smoke step boots the built API with `NODE_ENV=production` and default credentials, and asserts a non-zero exit.
  - `debug-surface.e2e-spec.ts`, which boots production mode, gets a production-valid fake env.
- **D-06: Database pool, logging and timeouts.**
  - The `pg` pool gets `max`, `idleTimeoutMillis`, `connectionTimeoutMillis`, `statement_timeout` and a `pool.on("error")` listener that logs.
  - `statement_timeout` defaults to 10 s, overridable by env.
  - Every `console.*` in `api/src` moves to the Nest `Logger`.
  - A failed authentication logs only the message and the error code: no token, no header, no stack.
  - Auth0 `/userinfo` gets a timeout.

- **D-18 (Claude, from the pattern map C-1): the deploy guard replaces a pre-merge check against the new image.**
  - **Why:** the new image only exists after the merge to main, and `infra/vps/update-stack.sh` runs from the VPS git checkout, which it fast-forwards before pulling the image.
  - **What the plan does:** add a step to `update-stack.sh` between `compose pull` and `compose up -d`: `compose run --rm --no-deps api node api/dist/config/check-config.js`. If that check fails, the script logs the plain-language report and exits without restarting, so the old stack keeps serving and there is no outage.
  - **Also for the plan:**
    - A dependency-free check the owner can run *before* merging on the current VPS, e.g. `infra/vps/check-env.sh` fetched with one `curl` from the branch. It checks the same rules on the env file.
    - Default detection uses a case-insensitive `change[-_]?me` prefix plus the known dev defaults, as in pattern-map C-2. The storage access key `minio` remains allowed.
    - List query params stay individual `@Query` strings, not a class DTO, because of `forbidNonWhitelisted` (C-4).
    - The upsert fast path falls back to the locked path only on 0 affected rows, never on an error (C-5).
- **D-19 (Claude): the MinIO switch happens automatically at deploy.** On deploy, `compose up -d` recreates MinIO with the new image, because the compose file comes from the fast-forwarded checkout. So the owner's MinIO volume backup must happen *before* the merge. The phase-gate checklist orders it that way:
  1. Back up the volume.
  2. Set `CORS_ORIGIN=none` and run the pre-merge env check.
  3. Merge.
  4. Claude checks `/v1/health` and the owner-check simulation logic against what is observable.
- **D-21 (orchestrator): the first deploy of this phase must already run the guarded script.**
  - **Why:** `update-stack.sh` fast-forwards the checkout and then keeps executing the copy it started with. The first deploy after the merge would therefore run the old, unguarded script, and a bad env would take the API down before the D-18 guard ever runs.
  - **Plan 07** keeps the guard in `update-stack.sh` and adds a self re-exec: after the fast-forward, if `infra/vps/update-stack.sh` changed, `exec` the new copy once, with a loop-guard env var. Later script changes then take effect in the same run.
  - **This phase's first deploy** is covered by the owner's single VPS sitting (plan 14 checklist), in this order:
    1. Back up the MinIO volume.
    2. Set `CORS_ORIGIN=none`.
    3. Run `check-env.sh` (fetched with `git show` from the pushed branch) until it reports OK.
    4. `sudo systemctl stop cortege-deploy.timer`.
    5. Merge the PR on GitHub.
    6. Wait for the main CI image job (about 3-5 min; Claude gives the Actions URL).
    7. `git -C /home/ubuntu/cortege fetch origin main && git -C /home/ubuntu/cortege merge --ff-only origin/main`.
    8. `sudo systemctl start cortege-deploy.timer` (or run `update-stack.sh` once by hand). The new, guarded script then does the deploy.
  - No separate infra PR.

### Service split (REQ-AUD-surveys-split)

- **D-07: Boundary.** Follow RESEARCH Pattern 3.
  - `SurveysRepository`, with a column-scoped `findOwned`.
  - `SurveyEventsService`, with `insert(db, surveyId, actorId: string | null, type, payload)`. It replaces the three `insertEvent` copies, including the inline one in `reports.service.ts`.
  - `SurveyEventsService` and `SurveysRepository` live in an exported `SurveysDataModule`, imported by `SurveysModule` and `ReportsModule`.
  - `ParcelsService`.
  - `PublicMapService`.
  - `SurveysService`, which keeps upsert, patch, visibility, submit, delete and getById.
  - `getSurveyForUser` and `insertEvent` must each exist exactly once, checked by grep.
  - Routes and response shapes do not change. The black-box E2E suites are the safety net.
- **D-08: IGN merge.**
  - The WFS client moves into `CadastreProviderService`.
  - One `fetchJson` uses `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` and keeps the body read inside the timed region.
  - Per-tile cache: z15 tiles, `lru-cache` with a 24 h TTL, bounded by count and size. Study status is never cached.
  - At most 16 tiles per request; beyond that, the request uses the DB path.
  - The "studied parcels" query is restricted by the fetched commune codes.
  - The silent `catch {}` becomes a Logger warning.
- **D-09 (Claude): fewer queries per sync op.** This replaces how 01.4 D-06 is realised on the upsert path, but not its invariant.
  - **Create:** one atomic writable-CTE statement, with no explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`. It writes the parcels, the survey (`ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`), the links and the event.
  - **Update:** an unlocked read (full row, parcel ids and `xmin::text`), then one CTE guarded by `xmin`. The CTE diffs the links with a disjoint `parcel_id <> ALL($ids)` delete and writes the event.
  - **Fallback:** if either statement affects 0 rows, run the existing locked-transaction path, deduplicated into one helper.
  - **Invariants kept:**
    - the row, links and event commit together or not at all;
    - the `sync_version` guards;
    - the same-version content rule (01.6 D-04/D-16);
    - submitted surveys are read-only;
    - `survey_id_conflict` on a foreign id;
    - the fault-injection E2E still passes.
  - **Target:** a committed E2E query-budget spec counts statements for 100 creates and 100 updates, 1 and 3 parcels each, and asserts at least 3x fewer than the recorded baseline (1 001 / 901 / 1 301 / 1 101). The spec is written first.
  - Other op types keep their transactions.
- **D-10: Batched writes.**
  - `ensureParcelIds` becomes one `INSERT … SELECT unnest … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
  - `validateParcelSubmit` becomes one `GROUP BY` query.
  - `computeSurveyDisplayLocation` becomes one query on the generated columns.
  - The sorted `FOR UPDATE` lock order in `submitSurvey` (01.4 D-08) is not changed.
- **D-11: Cursor pagination.**
  - Applies to `GET /surveys`, `GET /surveys/:id/events` and `GET /reports`.
  - Without `limit`, the response is identical to today's: all rows, same order plus a deterministic tiebreaker, `next_cursor: null`.
  - With `limit` (1..100), it uses keyset paging with an opaque `v1:` base64url cursor.
- **D-12: One strict cursor validator.**
  - It is shared by the new list cursors and the legacy sync cursor: strict timestamp regex plus a date round-trip, and any failure returns 400.
  - Postgres 22007/22008 raised by a cursor cast is also mapped to 400, as a backstop.
  - The docs lines that promise 400 then become true.

### Database (REQ-AUD-db-tuning)

- **D-13: Migration 015, using the verified DDL from RESEARCH Pattern 6.**
  - A partial index on public, submitted, non-deleted surveys.
  - Generated `centroid_lat`/`centroid_lng` columns guarded by a nested `CASE`, so non-numeric rows become NULL instead of failing the migration, with a btree index. No PostGIS.
  - An index on `survey_events(actor_id)`.
  - Drop the three verified-redundant indexes.
  - `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS auth_sessions` (and the related tables) as a safety measure, with a test.
  - The two public queries are rewritten so the plans use the indexes (RESEARCH figures: map items 23.6 → 5.0 ms at 10 000 surveys).
- **D-14: Migration runner.** `scripts/migrate.js` takes a session-level `pg_advisory_lock(<constant>)` around the loop and unlocks in `finally`. A test runs two concurrent migrations on an empty database, and both succeed.
- **D-15: EXPLAIN evidence.** A committed script seeds 10 000 surveys, runs `ANALYZE` and `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on the public queries and the paginated lists, and rolls back in one transaction. Its output is attached to the phase PR and recorded in VALIDATION.md.

### Infra (carried in)

- **D-16 (owner): MinIO image.**
  - `infra/docker-compose.yml` and `infra/docker-compose.vps.yml` move to `pgsty/minio`, pinned by the same digest as CI, in its own small plan.
  - Local check (Docker works in the sandbox): start the stack's MinIO with the new image on a volume written by a MinIO release; if the old image is no longer pullable, write the volume with the fork's older tag. Then confirm the bucket and objects survive.
  - `infra/vps/README.md` gets the owner commands: back up the MinIO volume, pull, restart MinIO, check health.

### Owner involvement

- **D-17 (owner): the owner does exactly one VPS visit, before merging the phase PR.**
  1. Run the pre-flight check against `/home/ubuntu/cortege.env`.
  2. Fix what it reports, including `CORS_ORIGIN=none`.
  3. Back up the MinIO volume.
  4. Switch MinIO to the new image.
  - The phase gate plan gives these as one short, copy-paste French checklist.
  - Everything else, including the device-style checks, is verified by Claude (STATE decision of 2026-09-25): the committed simulation script, extended to cover pagination and the config refusal, and run against the built API in MinIO mode.

### Claude's Discretion

- Exact file layout under `api/src/surveys/` and `api/src/config/`.
- Pool numbers other than the defaults above.
- Cache sizing, tuned within the stated bounds.
- How the query counter is wired in the budget spec. RESEARCH proved the `pg.Client.prototype.query` spy.
