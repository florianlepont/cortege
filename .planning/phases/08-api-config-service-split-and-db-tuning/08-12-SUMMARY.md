# Phase 01.7 Plan 12: Upsert fast path Summary

**A 100-operation sync batch now issues 201 statements, whether it holds creates or updates and whether each operation has 1 or 3 parcels. The baseline was 1 001 / 901 / 1 301 / 1 101, so the batch is 4.5x to 6.5x cheaper. An upsert is an unlocked read followed by one atomic writable-CTE statement. Creates use `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`. Updates are guarded by `xmin`, `sync_version` and `status`. The existing locked transaction is the only fallback, and it runs only when that statement affected 0 rows. The safety-net E2E specs pass without edits.**

## Query budget (final)

The counts come from `sync-query-budget.e2e-spec.ts` and include the request's one auth lookup. They were identical across five full-suite runs (four local, one MinIO) and the targeted runs.

| Case (100 `survey.upsert` ops) | Baseline (before 01.7) | After plan 09 | Now | Limit `floor(BASELINE / 3)` | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| creates, 1 parcel each | 1 001 | 901 | **201** | 333 | 4.98x |
| updates (v2), same 1 parcel | 901 | 901 | **201** | 300 | 4.48x |
| creates, 3 parcels each | 1 301 | 901 | **201** | 433 | 6.47x |
| updates (v2), same 3 parcels | 1 101 | 901 | **201** | 367 | 5.48x |
| 1 create, 1 new parcel | n/a | 10 | 3 | n/a (must equal the 50-parcel case) | |
| 1 create, 50 new parcels | n/a | 10 | 3 | n/a | |

Each operation costs 2 statements: statement A (the unlocked read) and statement B (the CTE). The single-create cases are auth + A + B.

**RED (Task 1, on the plan-11 code):** all four cases measured 901 against limits of 333 / 300 / 433 / 367, so the 4 tests failed and the 50-vs-1 case passed. **Intermediate (after Task 2, create only):** creates 201, updates 1 001. On that commit an update paid for statement A plus the whole locked path.

No budget operation went straight to the locked path because of a parcel lookup. The upsert never resolves parcels from coordinates: `selectParcelIds` only uses `parcel_ids`, the legacy `parcel_id`, or the stored links. So the count of such operations is 0.

## Accomplishments

- **Statement A, `readForUpsert`:** one unlocked `SELECT s.*, s.xmin::text AS cas_token, COALESCE((SELECT array_agg(parcel_id ORDER BY parcel_id) …), '{}') AS parcel_ids … WHERE s.id = $1 AND s.user_id = $2`. The user predicate is kept (T-01.7-50).
- **Create, `createSurveyAtomic`:** a CTE in this order:
  - `input_parcels`: an unnest of sorted parallel arrays, with commune/section/number from `parseParcelIdentifier` and fresh UUIDs, the same derivation as `ensureParcelIds`.
  - `ins`: `INSERT INTO surveys … ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING RETURNING id, updated_at::text`, with `status 'draft'`, the server-side `expires_at`, and `version_number = COALESCE($7, <getDefaultVersionNumber subquery>)`.
  - `ensured`: parcels `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ins)`, inserted in `parcel_id` order.
  - `links`.
  - `ev`: `SURVEY_EVENT_INSERT_SQL SELECT … 'created' … FROM ins`.

  When it returns 0 rows, the operation runs `upsertLocked`. That path answers `survey_id_conflict` (same bytes as before) for another user's id, and continues as an update for a concurrent create by the same user.
- **Update, `updateSurveyIfUnchanged`:** a CTE in this order:
  - `u`: `UPDATE … WHERE id AND user_id AND xmin = $23::xid AND sync_version < $14 AND status <> 'submitted'`.
  - `input_parcels`.
  - `ensured`: gated on `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM u)`.
  - `d`: `DELETE … WHERE survey_id IN (SELECT id FROM u) AND parcel_id <> ALL($16::text[])`.
  - `i`: `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (survey_id, parcel_id) DO NOTHING`.
  - `ev`: the "updated" event.

  When it returns 0 rows, the operation runs `upsertLocked`.
- **Routing in `upsertForUser`** (decisions on statement A's row, same rules as before):
  - an older `sync_version` is a 409 `sync_version_conflict` (same shape);
  - the same `sync_version` is classified with `classifySameVersionContent`:
    - identical: answered from the read, nothing written;
    - conflict: 409;
    - visibility-only on a live row: `upsertLocked`, which keeps `applyVisibilityChange` in its transaction;
    - visibility-only on a soft-deleted row: answered `synced` without a write, as before;
  - a submitted survey goes to `upsertLocked` (read-only rule and restricted update unchanged);
  - a newer version uses the CAS CTE.
- **`upsertLocked`:** the pre-D-09 transaction, moved as a whole. There were three "re-read under lock" copies. They are now two helpers:
  - `lockedReRead(db, id, user, "survey_id_conflict" | "not_found")`, used 3 times;
  - `settleMissedLockedWrite`, used twice, for the same-version replay or a 409.

  The pure parts are split out as `selectParcelIds` and `versionDefaults`, which the fast path shares, so both paths derive the same values.
- **C-5:** there is no `try/catch` around either fast statement. The only `catch` in `surveys.service.ts` is the pre-existing one in `submitSurvey`. The unit spec proves that a rejected create or update propagates and `db.transaction` is never called.
- **Untouched:** `submitSurvey`'s sorted `FOR UPDATE` block (D-10 / 01.4 D-08), patch, visibility, delete, attachments and the other sync operation types.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: tighten the budget to 3x and add the CAS race spec (RED):** `985e702` (test).
2. **Task 2: unlocked read, single-statement create, deduplicated locked fallback:** `1d7df21` (feat). It also includes the fast-path unit spec, committed once it compiled, as the plan required.
3. **Task 3: xmin-guarded single-statement update, budget GREEN:** `8f24d90` (feat).

## Verification

- **Refactor-only proof:** before any fast path was wired, `upsertForUser` was temporarily routed straight to `upsertLocked` and the full E2E suite was run. 22 suites passed. The only failures were the two new RED specs (budget, and CAS "spy not called"). The locked path still measured 901, so the extraction alone changed nothing.
- **Targeted, Task 2:** the five safety-net suites plus CAS: 56 passed. Budget creates were 201; updates were 1 001, as expected at that point.
- **CAS spec:** run 3 times in a row, 4/4 each time.
  - **Mutation check:** I replaced `xmin = $23::xid` with `$23::xid IS NOT NULL`. The visibility-race case then failed (`visibility` came back `"private"` instead of `"public"`), so the spec detects a missing CAS. I restored the guard afterwards.
  - The submit-race case still passed under the mutant, because `status <> 'submitted'` also guards it.
- **Unit:** `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` passed 29 suites and 631 tests, exit 0, with all thresholds met. `src/surveys` is at 80.68% statements, 67.55% branches, 79.07% functions and 81.79% lines. `surveys.repository.ts` is at 98.8% statements and 100% lines. The fast-path spec has 15 tests.
- **Full E2E, local mode** (`ibp_p17_12_test`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` unset, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`): 24 suites, 170 passed, 3 skipped (the MinIO-only cases), 173 total. I ran it three times: twice before the final grep-alignment edit and once after it.
- **Full E2E, MinIO mode** (own container `p17-12-minio` on port 19600, the pinned `pgsty/minio` digest from ci.yml, removed afterwards): 24 suites, 172 passed, 1 skipped, 173 total. This run happened before the grep-alignment edit. That edit changes the source text of the two SQL constants only; the rendered SQL is the same.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` are clean, and `prettier --check` on the 7 changed files is clean.
- **Safety nets unchanged:** `git diff claude/code-audit-complete-3sn99m` on `surveys-transactions`, `e2e-fault-injection`, `surveys-same-version`, `surveys-idempotency`, `sync-installed-app-compat` and `sync-changes-ordering` is empty. The fault-injected create and update still answer `retryable_error` and leave nothing behind, and the update case heals on replay.
- **Acceptance greps:**
  - in `surveys.service.ts`: `upsertLocked(` 5;
  - in `surveys.repository.ts`: `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ins)` 1, `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM u)` 1, `xmin = ` 1, `parcel_id <> ALL(` 1, `SURVEY_EVENT_INSERT_SQL` 3;
  - `INSERT INTO survey_events` in `api/src`: 1, in `survey-events.sql.ts`;
  - the `/ 3` budget expression is in the spec.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] `SURVEY_EVENT_INSERT_SQL` moved to a leaf module**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** `survey-events.service.ts` imports `SurveysRepository`, which it needs as its constructor parameter type for Nest DI metadata. If the repository imported the constant back from that file, the two modules would form a cycle. Depending on load order, either the SQL template would read `undefined` or `SurveyEventsService` would lose its injected type.
- **Fix:** `api/src/surveys/survey-events.sql.ts` holds the constant. `survey-events.service.ts` imports and re-exports it, so existing importers are unchanged, and the repository imports the leaf. The constant is still the only spelling of the insert in `api/src`.
- **Files:** `survey-events.sql.ts` (new) and `survey-events.service.ts`. Neither is in `files_modified`.
- **Commit:** 1d7df21

**2. [Rule 2 - Correctness] Same-version visibility-only writes and submitted surveys stay on the locked path**
- **Found during:** Task 3
- **Issue:** The plan sends only newer, non-submitted versions to the CAS CTE. It does not say how a same-version visibility-only write or a submitted-survey upsert should run.
- **Fix:** Both go to `upsertLocked`. The first then uses today's `applyVisibilityChange` transaction, as the plan's step 4 asks. The second uses the read-only rule and the restricted update. Neither case is in the budget. The same-version cases that never write (identical, conflict, visibility-only on a soft-deleted row) are answered from statement A.
- **Commit:** 8f24d90

**3. [Rule 2 - Test coverage] Link-diff E2E case**
- **Found during:** Task 3
- **Issue:** The update CTE replaces "DELETE all + INSERT" with a diff, and no existing spec changes a survey's parcel set through the fast path.
- **Fix:** Added a case to `surveys-upsert-cas.e2e-spec.ts`. It moves the set from {1,2} to {3,2} to {}. It checks that the links follow, that parcel 3 is registered, that `surveys.parcel_id` becomes the new first parcel, and that the events are created, updated, updated.
- **Commit:** 8f24d90

**4. The ensured-parcels CTE is spelled out in both statements**
- **Issue:** A first version built it from one helper with `${writeCte}`, so the plan's literal source greps (`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ins)` / `… FROM u`) did not match.
- **Fix:** Only the shared `INSERT … SELECT … FROM input_parcels ip` head is a constant. Each statement writes its own `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ins|u)`. The rendered SQL is unchanged. After this edit, lint, typecheck, format, unit with coverage and one full local E2E run all passed. The edit was folded into the Task 3 commit.
- **Commit:** 8f24d90

### Behaviour notes

- **Link `created_at` on an update:** links that are kept now keep their original `created_at`, where the old code deleted and re-inserted every link. Nothing in `api/src` reads `survey_parcels.created_at`. The locked path still uses `syncSurveyParcels` (DELETE all + INSERT). The plan allowed moving it to the diff form, but I left it unchanged so the fallback stays byte-identical.
- **Snapshot of a no-write same-version answer:** an identical replay, or a 409 decided on statement A's row, is linearised at that read instead of under a row lock. `sync_version` is monotonic and read-only fields cannot change without a version bump, so the outcome is the one the locked path would give at that instant.

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree had no `node_modules`. The root, api and mobile `node_modules` are symlinked from `/home/user/cortege`; they are untracked and not committed.
- The E2E runs used the scratchpad wrapper `p17-12-e2e.sh`. It sources `e2e-env.sh` with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p17_12_test`, unsets `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, uses `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p17-12`, adds the MinIO variables (port 19600) in minio mode, and runs under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`. The database already existed.

## Known Stubs

None.

## Threat Flags

None. There is no new route or trust boundary. The plan's threats are mitigated as follows:
- **T-01.7-48:** xmin CAS plus the `sync_version` and `status` predicates. A miss goes to the locked path. Covered by the CAS race spec, with the mutation check.
- **T-01.7-49:** single statement or the existing transaction. The fault-injection E2E is unchanged and green.
- **T-01.7-50:** `user_id` is in statement A and in both CTEs. A foreign id goes through the locked path to `survey_id_conflict`, and no parcel is registered (E2E).
- **T-01.7-51:** `status <> 'submitted'` in the CAS, submitted surveys are routed to the locked path, and there is a concurrent-submit E2E.
- **T-01.7-52:** the budget spec is committed at `floor(BASELINE / 3)`.
