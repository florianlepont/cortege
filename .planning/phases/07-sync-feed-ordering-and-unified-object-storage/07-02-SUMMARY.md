# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "All stored-file I/O goes through StorageService; storage keys are built only by its key builders, which call isSafeId on every id segment"
    - "Every keyed call validates the key (non-empty string, no NUL, relative, and resolveLocalPath containment in local mode) before touching storage"
    - "Missing objects are null (NotFound / NoSuchKey / HTTP 404 / ENOENT); every other error propagates"

key-files:

  modified:
    - api/src/common/file.utils.ts
    - api/jest.unit.config.js

key-decisions:
  - "The S3 branch is selected by the presence of the client (created only in minio mode), so the service has a single mode switch; presignPut/presignGet throw a plain Error outside minio mode, as the contract says (callers build the local routes themselves)"
  - "presignPut also rejects a declared size that is not a non-negative safe integer (400) before signing, so a NaN or negative ContentLength never reaches the SDK"
  - "deleteObject runs the key check inside its try block: an invalid key is a silent no-op and never touches storage, keeping the method's never-throws contract"
  - "getObject returns null when the S3 response has no Body, treated like a missing object"
  - "The key check applies path containment in local mode only (per the contract); in minio mode it still rejects empty, NUL-containing and absolute keys"

patterns-established:
  - "Plans 04, 06 and 07 inject StorageService (import StorageModule) and delete their own S3 client, bucket defaults, ensureBucket and cleanup copies when they switch callers"

# Phase 01.6 Plan 02: StorageService, shared safe-id pattern and MIME own-property fix Summary

**A single `StorageService` (one S3 client, unified default bucket `ibp-media`, contained local paths, safe-id key builders, signed `ContentLength` on presigned PUTs, null-on-missing reads), a shared `SAFE_ID_PATTERN`, and a MIME allow-list that no longer accepts prototype keys such as `constructor`.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min (first task commit 15:13:01Z, last task commit 15:17:44Z)
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T15:12:30Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T15:17:44Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (both TDD)
- **Files modified:** 7 (5 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `isAllowedMimeType` and `extensionFromMime` use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES, ...)`, so `"constructor"`, `"__proto__"`, `"toString"`, `"hasOwnProperty"` and `"valueOf"` are rejected (D-09, D-16). `extensionFromMime` still throws for unknown types; callers check `isAllowedMimeType` first.
- `api/src/common/safe-id.ts` exports `SAFE_ID_PATTERN = /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}$/` and `isSafeId(value: unknown): value is string`, with the derivation (mobile `survey-<ms>` and UUID survey ids, server UUID attachment and user ids, `e2e-survey-<ms>` fixtures, 128 = existing `@MaxLength`) recorded in a comment (D-14).
- `StorageService` implements the contract from the plan's interfaces block: `mode`, both key builders (same key formats as today, so stored keys stay valid), `putObject`, `presignPut` (PutObjectCommand with `ContentType` and `ContentLength`, 15 min), `presignGet` (GetObjectCommand, `DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS` = 300), `headObject`, `getObject` (`Body.transformToByteArray()` into a `Buffer`), best-effort `deleteObject`, and `resolveLocalPath` (throws `BadRequestException("Invalid storage key")` outside the root). Lazy `ensureBucket`, moved from `surveys-attachments.service.ts`, runs before put, presign, head and get (D-05, D-07, D-08, D-14, D-15).
- Key builders throw `BadRequestException` for unsafe id segments and for unsupported or prototype-key MIME types, never the plain `Error` that used to become a 500.
- `StorageModule` is non-global (`providers` + `exports`); consumers import it explicitly.
- Coverage for `./src/storage/`: statements 99.18%, branches 94.54%, functions 100%, lines 100%. The new threshold row is `{ statements: 99, branches: 94, functions: 100, lines: 100 }`. `./src/common/` rose to statements 85, branches 88, functions 55, lines 85 (row left unchanged, per the plan).

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (one commit per task per the orchestrator's instructions; for each, the spec was written and seen failing before the implementation):

1. **Task 1: Own-property MIME check and shared safe-id pattern:** `7fa989b` (fix)
2. **Task 2: StorageService and StorageModule with unit proof:** `180721d` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/common/file.utils.ts`: own-property lookup in both helpers
- `api/src/common/safe-id.ts`: new, `SAFE_ID_PATTERN` + `isSafeId`
- `api/test/file.utils.spec.ts`: new, 38 cases (MIME accept/reject incl. prototype keys, extension mapping and throws, safe-id accept/reject incl. non-strings)
- `api/src/storage/storage.service.ts`: new, `StorageService`, `DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS`, `UPLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS`, `StorageMode`
- `api/src/storage/storage.module.ts`: new, `StorageModule`
- `api/test/storage.service.spec.ts`: new, 55 cases with `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, the presigner and `fs/promises` mocked (config and single client, bucket default, containment, key builders, keyed-call key checks, presign ContentLength, presignGet TTL, ensureBucket create and race paths, put/head/get/delete in both modes, module metadata)
- `api/jest.unit.config.js`: only the `'./src/storage/'` threshold row added

## Decisions Made

- The S3 code paths are chosen by the presence of the client, which exists only in minio mode, so the service has one mode switch and no "minio without client" state.
- `presignPut` rejects a declared size that is not a non-negative safe integer (400) before signing (T-01.6-06).
- `deleteObject` treats an invalid key as a silent no-op, so it keeps its never-throws contract without touching storage.
- The original storage code in `surveys-attachments.service.ts`, `surveys.service.ts` and `users.service.ts` is left in place, as the plan requires; plans 04, 06 and 07 remove it when they switch callers.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing validation] presignPut validates the declared size**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** the contract takes `contentLength: number` from callers, which comes from client-declared `size_bytes`; a NaN, fractional or negative value would reach the SDK signature unchecked.
- **Fix:** `BadRequestException("Invalid content length")` unless `Number.isSafeInteger(contentLength) && contentLength >= 0`; covered by the spec.
- **Files modified:** api/src/storage/storage.service.ts, api/test/storage.service.spec.ts
- **Commit:** 180721d

Other notes, not deviations:
- The plan's TDD tasks were committed as one commit per task (the orchestrator required one commit per task), not as separate `test`/`feat` commits. RED was observed for both tasks before implementing (the specs failed to compile against the missing modules).
- `api/jest.unit.config.js` was already not Prettier-formatted (single quotes) before this plan and is outside the repo's `format:check` glob (`**/*.{ts,tsx,json}`); it was left as is apart from the added row.

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree had no `node_modules`; the root, `api` and `mobile` `node_modules` directories of the main checkout were symlinked in (untracked, not committed).

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- `StorageService` / `StorageModule` are ready for plans 04 (users, profile pictures via `getObject` + `buildProfilePictureKey`), 05 (module wiring), 06 (survey deletion via `deleteObject`) and 07 (attachments via `buildAttachmentKey`, `presignPut`, `headObject`, `presignGet`, `putObject`).
- `SAFE_ID_PATTERN` / `isSafeId` are ready for DTO and pipe reuse at the boundary (D-14).
- Verification green in this worktree: `npm run lint` (0 problems), `npm run typecheck`, `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` (17 suites, 255/255 tests, all thresholds met including the new storage row), Prettier check on the six changed TS files. No E2E was required by this plan.
