# Phase 01.6: Sync feed ordering and unified object storage - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-09-25
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Owner decision during `/gsd:plan-phase 1.6` after research, plus Claude's technical decisions. Where this file departs from the research recommendations, it overrides them.

## Phase Boundary

This phase covers audit lots L10 and L13:

- `/v1/sync/changes` pages on a monotonic, commit-safe order, so no change is ever skipped. It still accepts the old cursor.
- Two different payloads sent with the same `sync_version` produce a conflict instead of a silent replay.
- The fallback that re-sent event-less surveys on every poll is removed.
- A single `StorageService` owns every stored file: survey attachments and profile pictures, in MinIO/S3 or local mode.
- Storage keys are built from validated identifiers and stay contained.
- Presigned uploads are bounded in size, and the MIME check is fixed.
- The contract docs are updated.

Installed apps must keep syncing without an update: the cursor is opaque to the client.

## Implementation Decisions

### Changes feed (REQ-AUD-changes-feed)
- D-01: Add `survey_events.seq` (bigint identity) through a migration that backfills existing rows in `(created_at, id)` order. Paging uses `seq`. The new cursor format is `seq:<n>`. A legacy `(created_at, id)` cursor is still accepted and translated to the matching `seq` position. The mobile client treats the cursor as opaque, so no app change is needed.
- D-02 (Claude, replaces the research's visibility delay): commit safety uses the transaction snapshot, not a time delay.
  - Each event stores `xid8 = pg_current_xact_id()`.
  - The feed only returns events whose transaction is older than `pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())`, meaning every transaction that could still insert a lower `seq` has finished.
  - This is exact rather than probabilistic, and it does not depend on how long transactions run (upserts can hold a transaction across an IGN call).
  - The E2E test commits two transactions out of `seq` order and proves nothing is skipped.
- D-03: The fallback that re-sends event-less surveys on every poll is removed. If some surveys never had an event, the migration inserts one synthetic event per such survey so they still reach other devices exactly once.

### Same-version conflict
- D-04: When the server receives the same `sync_version` it already stored, it compares content.
  - Identical content → still `synced`, as an idempotent replay.
  - Different content → 409 `sync_version_conflict`.
  - Applies to all three call sites. The content hash is computed on the fly; there is no stored column.
  - The mobile client already treats a 409 as fatal and keeps the local data, so this was checked against installed apps.

### Object storage (REQ-AUD-object-storage)
- D-05: A new `api/src/storage/` module exposes one `StorageService`. It owns the S3 client, the bucket and local mode (put, head, delete, presigned PUT/GET, download descriptor). The surveys, attachments and users services use it, and the drifted default bucket names are unified.
- D-06: **Profile pictures move to object storage. There is no recovery of existing files** (owner decision). Existing files were most likely lost on redeploys already. A user whose stored picture can no longer be found is shown as having no picture, with no error.
- D-07: Storage keys are built only from validated identifiers.
  - Route params `:id` and `:attachmentId` are validated as UUIDs.
  - In local mode, the resolved path must stay under the upload root; anything else is rejected.
- D-08: The presigned PUT carries a `ContentLength` bound to the declared size (signed header where the SDK and MinIO allow it). Confirmation always compares `HeadObject.ContentLength` with `size_bytes`; a mismatch gives 422 and the object is deleted.
- D-09: `isAllowedMimeType` uses an own-property check (`Object.hasOwn`), so `"constructor"` and other prototype keys are rejected.
- D-10 (Claude): CI gains a MinIO-mode E2E pass: a MinIO service container and `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=minio`. It covers presigned PUT, size mismatch (422) and the profile-picture round trip. The existing local-mode pass stays.

### Docs
- D-11: Update `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` and `api-contract-v1.md` with the new cursor, the snapshot rule and the same-version rule.

### Refinements after pattern mapping (Claude, overriding D-01/D-02/D-06/D-07 where they conflict)
- D-12 (C-1 fixes D-01/D-02): the feed orders and pages on the pair `(xid8, seq)`, filtered by `xid8 < pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())`.
  - Paging on `seq` alone skips events: an older transaction can insert a higher `seq` later. This was reproduced on PG 16.
  - The new cursor is `v2:<xid8>:<seq>`. `xid8` and `seq` stay strings end to end.
  - Index on `(xid8, seq)`.
  - `seq` (identity) and `xid8` (`DEFAULT pg_current_xact_id()`) come from column defaults, so none of the three event-insert sites change.
  - The snapshot minimum is cluster-wide, so a long transaction delays the feed but never makes it skip an event. This is documented.
- D-13 (C-5, C-6, C-10):
  - The migration backfills `seq` in `(created_at, id)` order: nullable column, `row_number()`, NOT NULL, identity, `setval`.
  - Synthetic events for surveys that have none are inserted after that.
  - Legacy cursors are translated with `(created_at, id) <= cursor`, including the old cursors that pointed at a survey. When there are no new events, the new cursor is returned.
  - A dedicated test runs the migration against seeded pre-migration rows.
- D-14 (C-2 replaces the UUID part of D-07): survey and attachment ids stay client-chosen TEXT, so there is no UUID pipe.
  - Every id that reaches a storage key must match a safe-character pattern. The storage key builder checks this itself, in addition to DTO and param validation. Local mode keeps the resolved-path containment check.
  - The planner derives the pattern from every id format the mobile app has ever generated (check the mobile git history), so no existing production id is rejected.
  - Ids outside the pattern get a 400 at the boundary.
- D-15 (C-3 refines D-05/D-06): profile pictures are served as bytes through the API (`getObject` on `StorageService`), never by redirecting to a presigned URL, because installed apps send a Bearer header.
  - A user whose stored object is missing appears with no picture. `/me` returns `profile_picture_url: null` when the object is absent, and a 404 on the picture route clears the stale columns.
  - Unsupported image types get a 4xx, never a 500.
  - The existing `auth-profile` E2E assertions keep passing.
- D-16 (C-4, C-7, C-8, C-11):
  - The E2E tests that asserted the removed fallback are inverted.
  - Fixtures whose declared size does not match what they upload are corrected.
  - D-04 compares content with the existing read-only-field comparison plus `visibility`, not a raw JSON hash.
  - **Amended 2026-09-25 (orchestrator, after plan check):** visibility is no longer a conflict trigger. Same `sync_version` with identical read-only fields → `synced`. When the ONLY difference is visibility, the server applies it last-writer-wins exactly like the version-less `visibility_update` action (visibility, `updated_at`, `visibility_changed` event) and answers `synced`. Any read-only difference → 409 `sync_version_conflict`. Reason: installed apps rewrite a pending upsert's visibility without bumping `sync_version`, so a retry after a lost response would otherwise be blocked. No mobile change.
  - The MIME own-property check uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` (the API targets ES2021).
- D-17 (C-9): the CI MinIO pass starts MinIO with a `docker run` step and a health wait, not `services:`. The planner keeps the E2E job within its timeout, splitting the job if needed.

### Claude's Discretion
- Plan split and waves: plans touching `surveys.service.ts`, `surveys-attachments.service.ts`, `users.service.ts` or `ci.yml` must be sequenced.
- Constants rather than new environment variables. Phase 01.7 introduces config validation.
- Coverage thresholds may only go up.
