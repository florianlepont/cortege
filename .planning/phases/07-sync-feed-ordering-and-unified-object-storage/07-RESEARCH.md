# Phase 01.6: Sync feed ordering and unified object storage - Research

**Researched:** 2026-09-25
**Domain:** PostgreSQL event-feed consistency (commit-order vs. insertion-order), Node.js/NestJS object storage (S3/MinIO client + local-disk fallback)
**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (code paths verified by direct read at file:line; the exact PostgreSQL snapshot/visibility mechanics and the presigned-URL ContentLength enforcement mechanic are MEDIUM/LOW and flagged as Open Questions)

## Summary

This phase closes two related but separable audit findings. **REQ-AUD-changes-feed** (ARCH-6) fixes two bugs in `/v1/sync/changes`: (1) the feed pages on `(created_at, id)` of `survey_events` committed in autocommit — a transaction that calls `NOW()`/inserts earlier but commits later can have its event permanently skipped by a poller that already advanced past that timestamp; (2) same-`sync_version` upserts are treated as unconditionally idempotent, so two devices racing to write version N+1 silently drop one device's data with no conflict signal. **REQ-AUD-object-storage** (A-H3, A-M3, A-M4, isAllowedMimeType) unifies three independently-instantiated S3 clients (different default buckets: `ibp-media` in `surveys.service.ts` and `surveys-attachments.service.ts`, `ibp-surveys` in `users.service.ts`) into one `StorageService`, and fixes: profile pictures always writing to local disk even when `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=minio` (lost on every redeploy — no volume on the API container), storage keys built from an unvalidated `:id` route param (path traversal in local mode), an unenforced presigned-PUT size limit, and a prototype-pollution-adjacent bug in `isAllowedMimeType` (`in` operator accepts `"constructor"`).

The critical technical risk in this phase is **not** "add a sequence column" — it's that a bare `bigserial` does not, by itself, fix the skip bug. Sequence values are assigned when `nextval()` runs inside a transaction, but the row only becomes visible to other transactions at COMMIT. Two concurrent `/v1/sync` requests can acquire `seq=100` and `seq=101` in either order relative to their commit order; a poller that has already seen `seq=101` will never come back for `seq=100` once it finally commits. The research below documents this precisely and recommends a **short visibility delay** (exclude events newer than N seconds) as the pragmatic fix, because transactions in this codebase can hold open across an external IGN HTTP call (`resolveSelectedParcelIds`, timeout ~2.5s) — a fixed delay must be safely larger than that worst case. A `pg_snapshot_xmin`/`txid` based approach is more rigorous but adds real complexity; it is documented as an alternative for a future hardening pass.

Both requirement areas touch the same three "hotspot" files (`surveys-attachments.service.ts`, `surveys-sync.service.ts` transitively via `surveys.service.ts`, `users.service.ts`), which the planner must sequence rather than parallelize.

**Primary recommendation:** Add `survey_events.seq bigserial` and a **visibility delay** (`created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 'N seconds'`, N ≥ 10s, configurable) as the correctness mechanism for the changes feed; compute a normalized content hash for Case B comparison; extract one `StorageService` (S3 client + bucket + local-mode path resolution + MIME allow-list) used by all three existing services, route profile pictures through it, and validate `:id` params as UUIDs before they ever reach a storage key.

## Architectural Responsibility Map

| Capability | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Monotonic changes-feed ordering | API / Backend (Postgres) | — | Ordering guarantee must be enforced at the query/schema level; mobile only consumes an opaque cursor |
| Cursor compatibility (old `(created_at,id)` + new `seq`) | API / Backend | Mobile (passive) | API decides cursor semantics; mobile already treats the cursor as an opaque stored string (`mobile/src/storage/sync.ts:1126-1166`) — no mobile code change needed if the new cursor is still a string the client stores and replays verbatim |
| Same-version conflict detection (content hash) | API / Backend | — | Requires comparing stored vs. incoming normalized payload; pure server-side business rule |
| Object storage (S3 client, bucket, local mode) | API / Backend | — | Single service boundary; mobile and web clients only ever see URLs (presigned or `/…/content`) |
| Profile picture storage | API / Backend | — | Same `StorageService` as attachments; no client-visible change beyond URL host |
| Upload size enforcement | API / Backend | — | Must be enforced server-side (presign parameters + confirm-time `HeadObject` compare); client cannot be trusted |
| MIME allow-list | API / Backend | — | Server is the sole authority; mobile has its own picker but the API must not trust client-declared MIME blindly |

## User Constraints

No CONTEXT.md exists yet for this phase (confirmed: `.planning/phases/07-sync-feed-ordering-and-unified-object-storage/` contained no files before this research). The phase's binding constraints instead come directly from `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (Phase 01.6 section) and the two REQUIREMENTS.md entries — both quoted verbatim below since they function as locked scope for this phase.

### Locked scope (ROADMAP.md, Phase 01.6 Success Criteria — verbatim)

1. `/v1/sync/changes` pages on a monotonic sequence (`survey_events.seq`), still accepts the old `(created_at, id)` cursor, and an event committed late is never skipped (E2E test).
2. Two devices sending the same `sync_version` with different content get a `sync_version_conflict` instead of a silent replay; the fallback that re-sends event-less surveys on every poll is gone.
3. One `StorageService` owns the S3 client, bucket and local mode for surveys, attachments and users; profile pictures are in object storage and survive a container restart.
4. Storage keys are built only from validated identifiers and stay inside the upload directory in local mode; the presigned PUT enforces `ContentLength` and confirmation rejects a size mismatch with 422.
5. `isAllowedMimeType` uses an own-property check, so `"constructor"` and other prototype keys are rejected.
6. `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` and `api-contract-v1.md` describe the new cursor and same-version rule.

### Requirement definitions (REQUIREMENTS.md, verbatim)

- **REQ-AUD-changes-feed** — `/sync/changes` pages on a monotonic sequence and still accepts the old cursor; same-version replays with different content are conflicts; the per-poll re-send of event-less surveys is gone. *(Audit ARCH-6. Lot L10)*
- **REQ-AUD-object-storage** — One `StorageService` for surveys, attachments and users; profile pictures in object storage; storage keys contained; upload size enforced; MIME allow-list checked by own property. *(Audit A-H3, A-M3, A-M4. Lot L13)*

### Dependency and non-scope

Depends on Phase 01.4 (transactions, `sync_version` guard, `DatabaseService.transaction`) — already delivered and verified (see below). Out of scope for this phase (deferred to 01.7): `@nestjs/config` schema validation, `pg` pool tuning/error listener, `SurveysService` split, DB index/tuning work — do not fold those in even though `surveys.service.ts` is touched here.

<phase_requirements>
## Phase Requirements

| ID | Description | Research Support |
|----|-------------|------------------|
| REQ-AUD-changes-feed | `/sync/changes` pages on a monotonic sequence, keeps old cursor compat, same-version-different-content is a conflict, event-less-survey fallback removed | See "Standard Stack", "Architecture Patterns" (visibility delay), "Pitfalls" (sequence-order ≠ commit-order), Code Examples |
| REQ-AUD-object-storage | One `StorageService`, profile pictures in object storage, contained storage keys, enforced upload size, own-property MIME check | See "Don't Hand-Roll", "Architecture Patterns" (StorageService shape), Code Examples, Environment Availability (MinIO in prod) |
</phase_requirements>

## Standard Stack

### Core (already installed — no new packages)

| Library | Version (installed) | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `@aws-sdk/client-s3` | `^3.1004.0` [VERIFIED: api/package.json:42] | S3-compatible client (MinIO/AWS S3) | Already used identically in three services; consolidating, not replacing |
| `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` | `^3.1004.0` [VERIFIED: api/package.json:43] | Presigned PUT/GET URLs | Same |
| `pg` | already installed | Raw SQL, `db.transaction()` helper (api/src/database/database.service.ts:40-57) | Project convention — no ORM |
| `class-validator` / `class-transformer` | already installed | DTO validation, incl. `@IsUUID` for the `:id` param fix | Project convention (CLAUDE.md) |

**No new npm packages are required for this phase.** Both success criteria are achievable with the existing SDK versions and Postgres 16's native `bigserial`/`NOW()`. This significantly simplifies the legitimacy audit below.

### Version verification

```
$ grep '"@aws-sdk/client-s3"' api/package.json
    "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.1004.0",
$ grep '"@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner"' api/package.json
    "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner": "^3.1004.0",
```
[VERIFIED: api/package.json — read directly, 2026-09-25]

### Alternatives Considered

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Visibility-delay ordering guarantee | `pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())` / stored `txid` low-watermark | More rigorous (no fixed delay assumption), but requires storing a transaction-id column, computing a snapshot per poll, and reasoning about `txid` wraparound over long retention — meaningfully more implementation and test surface for a lot sized "M" in the remediation doc |
| Presigned PUT `signableHeaders` content-length enforcement | Presigned POST (`createPresignedPost` with `content-length-range` condition) | POST-policy uploads cryptographically enforce a size range, but require switching the mobile upload from a raw `PUT` (`FileSystem.uploadAsync` binary) to a multipart form POST — a client-side change explicitly out of scope per D-01 of Phase 01.5 CONTEXT ("the storage unification stays in phase 01.6" as an API-only change) |

## Package Legitimacy Audit

No external packages are being newly installed in this phase — both `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` are pre-existing dependencies already in `api/package.json` and in production use. The Package Legitimacy Gate is **not applicable**; no `slopcheck`/registry verification was run because there is nothing new to verify.

**Packages removed due to slopcheck [SLOP] verdict:** none (n/a — no new packages)
**Packages flagged as suspicious [SUS]:** none (n/a — no new packages)

```

### Pattern 1: Visibility-delay ordering (recommended fix for ARCH-6 skip bug)

**What:** Never return an event to a poller until it is old enough (`created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 'N seconds'`) that every transaction which could still be assigning a *lower* `seq` value is guaranteed to have already committed or rolled back.
**When to use:** Any Postgres-backed "changes feed"/outbox pattern built on a `bigserial`/`SERIAL` column, where writers are ordinary autocommit-independent transactions (not a single serialized writer).
**Why this is necessary and a bare `bigserial` is not sufficient:**
- `nextval()` (which backs `bigserial`) is called and its value is fixed the instant the `INSERT` statement executes — *before* the transaction commits.
- Two concurrent transactions, A and B, can acquire `seq=100` and `seq=101` respectively, in that order, but B can commit before A (e.g., A is a slower `upsertForUser` transaction that also awaits an IGN cadastre HTTP call inside the transaction — see `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:217,223` `resolveSelectedParcelIds` called inside `db.transaction(...)`, with `CADASTRE_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` defaulting to 2500ms at `surveys.service.ts:93`).
- A poller that queries `seq > 101` immediately after B commits will never come back for `seq=100` — it has already advanced its cursor past a value that has not yet appeared. This is the exact same class of bug the audit found with `created_at`, just moved to `seq`.
- A visibility delay solves this by never exposing `seq=101` until enough time has passed that `seq=100`'s transaction is guaranteed finished (committed or rolled back). Since Postgres transactions in this codebase are bounded by the connection/HTTP request lifecycle (NestJS request timeout, plus the ~2.5s IGN timeout), a delay of 10s (configurable, e.g. `SYNC_FEED_VISIBILITY_DELAY_SECONDS`) gives an order-of-magnitude safety margin over the worst observed transaction duration.
- Tradeoff: freshly-committed events are invisible to pollers for up to N seconds. For an offline-first field-survey app where sync happens on reconnect (not real-time chat), this is an acceptable and explicit tradeoff, not a hidden correctness gap.

```sql
-- Source: derived from the well-known Postgres "gapless sequence reader" pattern
-- (transactional outbox / CDC feed via monotonic id + visibility window).
-- No official single canonical doc; documented here as the phase's chosen approach — [ASSUMED: pattern correctness, not verified against an official Postgres doc for this exact case].
SELECT e.seq, e.id, e.survey_id, e.actor_id, e.event_type, e.payload, e.created_at::text
FROM survey_events e
JOIN surveys s ON s.id = e.survey_id
WHERE s.user_id = $1
  AND e.seq > $2
  AND e.created_at < NOW() - ($3 || ' seconds')::interval
ORDER BY e.seq ASC
LIMIT $4
```

### Pattern 2: Content-hash comparison for same-`sync_version` replays (Case B fix)

**What:** When `syncVersion === existing.sync_version` (the three call sites at `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:318`, `:368`, `:467`), compute a normalized content hash of the incoming payload's business fields (site_name, factors, scores, parcel selection, visibility — excluding server-computed fields like `updated_at`) and compare it against a stored hash of the existing row. If they match: idempotent replay, return `synced` (current behavior, correct). If they differ: return `sync_version_conflict` — the second device must resolve, not silently lose data.
**When to use:** Any optimistic-concurrency scheme (`sync_version`/`ETag`) where the same version number can legitimately be produced by two different clients racing to write "the next version."
**Implementation notes:**
- Store the hash either as a new `surveys.content_hash` column populated alongside every write, or compute it on-the-fly from the stored row (cheaper migration, no backfill needed, marginal CPU cost per upsert — recommended given `surveys` rows are small JSON blobs).
- Normalize before hashing: stable key ordering (`JSON.stringify` on a canonicalized object, or a library-free deterministic serializer) so re-ordered-but-identical JSON does not spuriously trigger a conflict.
- All three call sites in `surveys.service.ts` (create-path `syncVersion === existing.sync_version` at :318, submitted-read-only-replay at :368, and non-submitted-replay at :467) need the same check — this is the "same-file, sequenced plan" hotspot warning.

```typescript
// Illustrative shape only — exact normalization must be designed against
// the real SurveyUpsertBody shape in surveys.types.ts.
function normalizedContentHash(body: {
  site_name: string
  factors: unknown
  visibility: string
  parcel_ids?: string[]
}): string {
  const canonical = {
    site_name: body.site_name,
    factors: body.factors,
    visibility: body.visibility,
    parcel_ids: [...(body.parcel_ids ?? [])].sort(),
  }
  return createHash("sha256").update(JSON.stringify(canonical)).digest("hex")
}
```

### Pattern 3: Unified `StorageService`

**What:** A single injectable service that owns: (1) one `S3Client` instance (constructed once, from validated config), (2) the bucket name, (3) `objectStorageMode` ("local" | "minio"), (4) `putObject`/`presignPut`/`presignGet`/`head`/`delete` methods that branch on mode internally, (5) a `resolveLocalPath(key)` helper that validates the resolved path stays under the upload root, and (6) the MIME allow-list check.
**When to use:** Any time more than one NestJS service needs S3/local-disk file operations — exactly this codebase's situation today (three independent, drifted instantiations).
**Reuse the existing branching pattern already proven correct in phase 01.5's download endpoint** (`api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts:455-477` `buildDownloadUrl`, and `api/src/users/users.controller.ts:71-79` `StreamableFile` for local mode): presigned URL in `minio` mode, authenticated pass-through route in `local` mode. The new `StorageService` should expose a `getDownloadDescriptor(key): Promise<{url, requiresAuth} | {stream}>`-shaped API that both attachment and profile-picture download paths call, rather than duplicating the branch.

**Recommended shape:**
```typescript
// api/src/storage/storage.service.ts (new)
@Injectable()
export class StorageService {
  private readonly mode: "local" | "minio"
  private readonly bucket: string
  private readonly uploadsRootDir: string
  private readonly s3Client?: S3Client

  // one constructor reading OBJECT_STORAGE_* once; injected into
  // SurveysService, SurveysAttachmentsService, UsersService

  resolveLocalPath(key: string): string {
    const resolved = path.resolve(this.uploadsRootDir, key)
    const root = path.resolve(this.uploadsRootDir)
    if (resolved !== root && !resolved.startsWith(root + path.sep)) {
      throw new BadRequestException("invalid storage key")
    }
    return resolved
  }

  isAllowedMimeType(mime: string): boolean {
    return Object.hasOwn(ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES, mime.trim().toLowerCase())
  }

  async presignPut(key: string, mime: string, contentLength: number): Promise<string> {
    // see Pitfall on ContentLength enforcement below
  }

  async confirmUpload(key: string, declaredSizeBytes: number): Promise<void> {
    const head = await this.s3Client!.send(new HeadObjectCommand({ Bucket: this.bucket, Key: key }))
    if (head.ContentLength !== declaredSizeBytes) {
      await this.s3Client!.send(new DeleteObjectCommand({ Bucket: this.bucket, Key: key }))
      throw new UnprocessableEntityException("uploaded file size does not match declared size")
    }
  }
}
```

```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Assuming `bigserial` alone fixes ordering:** it fixes *pagination stability* (no duplicate/skip from timestamp collisions) but not the commit-order-vs-acquisition-order race — see Pitfall 1.
- **Enforcing upload size only at presign time:** a client can always send more/fewer bytes than declared to a presigned URL unless the size is cryptographically bound to the signature (see Pitfall 2) — the confirm-time `HeadObject` compare is the actually-reliable backstop and must not be treated as "just defense in depth."
- **Trusting `:id` route params as storage-key components without validation:** confirmed at `api/src/surveys/surveys.controller.ts` (`@Param("id") id: string` used across all survey/attachment routes) with no `ParseUUIDPipe`/regex guard, feeding directly into `surveys/${surveyId}/${attachmentId}${extension}` (`surveys-attachments.service.ts:198`) and `join(this.uploadsRootDir, storageKey)` (`surveys-attachments.service.ts:144,305`, `users.service.ts:396-398`) with no resolved-path containment check.

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Path traversal prevention | Custom regex blacklist on `..`/`/` | `path.resolve()` + prefix-check against the resolved upload root (Pattern 3 above) | Regex blacklists miss encoded/normalized variants; resolved-path comparison is the standard, exhaustive check |
| Content hashing for conflict detection | Custom deep-equality walker | Node's built-in `crypto.createHash("sha256")` over a canonicalized JSON string | `jsonDeepEqual` already exists in `surveys-normalize.utils.ts:39-67` for a different purpose (parcel-id-set comparison) — reuse the existing canonicalization idea but a hash comparison is simpler to store/compare for Case B than deep equality across three call sites |
| S3/MinIO client management | Multiple ad-hoc `new S3Client()` calls per service | One `StorageService` singleton (Pattern 3) | Exactly what this phase's success criterion #3 requires; also fixes the three-different-default-bucket drift the audit found (ARCH-2) |

**Key insight:** every "don't hand-roll" item here is really the same insight restated: centralize storage-adjacent logic (path resolution, MIME checking, bucket/client construction) in one place so the three services can no longer drift independently, which is exactly how the current bugs were introduced (three copies of near-identical S3 setup code, each slightly different).

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: `bigserial` does not guarantee "late commit never skipped"
**What goes wrong:** Implementing "paginate on `survey_events.seq bigserial`" literally as the only fix leaves the ARCH-6 skip bug present, just relocated from `created_at` collisions to `seq` acquisition-vs-commit-order races. An E2E test that inserts two events in two overlapping transactions where the lower-`seq` one commits second will still demonstrate a skip unless a visibility mechanism (delay, or snapshot/txid-based filtering) is added.
**Why it happens:** `nextval()` fires at statement execution time, not commit time; Postgres offers no built-in "assign sequence value at commit" primitive.
**How to avoid:** Add the visibility-delay filter (Pattern 1) or a `txid`/snapshot-based low-watermark filter. Write the E2E test *first* against two real overlapping transactions (not mocked) to prove whichever mechanism is chosen actually closes the gap — the existing test infra (`api/test/database-transaction.e2e-spec.ts`, `api/test/surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts`) already demonstrates the project's pattern for opening two client connections against `ibp_test` concurrently.
**Warning signs:** A test that starts two transactions sequentially and commits them in order will pass trivially even with the bug present — the test must deliberately commit out of acquisition order.

### Pitfall 2: Presigned PUT `ContentLength` is not enforced by default
**What goes wrong:** Setting `ContentLength` on a `PutObjectCommand` passed to `getSignedUrl` does **not**, by default, cryptographically bind the uploaded body size to the signature for SigV4 query-string presigned URLs. [MEDIUM confidence — WebSearch across AWS SDK v3 issue tracker and docs did not find a single authoritative statement either way; the AWS SDK v3 presigner README documents `signableHeaders`/`unhoistableHeaders` as the mechanism for forcing a header to be present and checked, and `content-length` is a normal HTTP header that can be added to `signableHeaders`, but this exact recipe was not found demonstrated end-to-end in the sources checked.] Treat "the presigned PUT enforces ContentLength" (success criterion #4) as requiring an explicit `signableHeaders: new Set(["content-length"])` (or equivalent) addition, verified with a real request against the project's pinned MinIO version (`quay.io/minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z`) — not just "pass ContentLength to the command and assume it's enforced."
**Why it happens:** SigV4 presigned URLs only sign the headers explicitly listed as signed; `content-length` is not signed by default because presigned uploads are commonly used with clients that determine body size at send time.
**How to avoid:** (1) explicitly add `content-length` to the signed header set when generating the presigned PUT URL, and require the mobile/API caller to send a matching `Content-Length` header — verify this actually causes MinIO to reject a mismatched upload with `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` in a real E2E test; (2) regardless of whether (1) can be made to work cleanly, **keep the confirm-time `HeadObject.ContentLength` vs. `size_bytes` compare + delete-and-422-on-mismatch** as the authoritative, always-correct backstop — this part has no ambiguity and is already partially structured in `surveys-attachments.service.ts:280-295` (currently only checks object *existence*, not size).
**Warning signs:** An E2E test that uploads a file of a different size than declared and expects `403` from MinIO before the confirm call, without also testing the confirm-time 422 path, is testing the less-reliable half of the fix.

### Pitfall 3: Migration-time table rewrite for `bigserial` + backfill
**What goes wrong:** `ALTER TABLE survey_events ADD COLUMN seq BIGSERIAL` (or `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`) rewrites the table if a NOT NULL sequence-backed default is applied in one statement, taking an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock for the duration on a table of unknown-but-likely-small current size (the app is pre-field-test, so production `survey_events` row counts are probably in the hundreds-to-low-thousands, not millions) [ASSUMED: no direct row count available from a live DB in this environment — flagged as an owner-verifiable fact before the plan executes the migration on the VPS].
**Why it happens:** Postgres 11+ optimizes constant-default `ADD COLUMN` to a metadata-only change, but a sequence-backed (`nextval()`) default is volatile and still requires a full table scan/rewrite.
**How to avoid:** Given the likely-small table size, a single-statement migration is probably safe; still, the migration should be tested against a copy of the production table size order-of-magnitude, and the plan should note this as a deploy-window consideration (the VPS is a single instance with a pull-based deploy — a multi-second lock during deploy is likely acceptable but should be an explicit, stated risk rather than an assumption). No `pg_advisory_lock` exists yet in `scripts/migrate.js` (confirmed by direct read) — this phase's migration runs without one, consistent with the audit's note that this is "acceptable with a single instance" (ARCH-7); the advisory lock itself is deferred to Phase 01.7/lot L16.
**Warning signs:** Migration takes noticeably longer than the other 13 existing migrations when run against `ibp_test`/local dev — the planner should have the executing agent time the migration run.

### Pitfall 4: `isAllowedMimeType`'s `in` operator accepts prototype keys
**What goes wrong:** `mimeType in ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` returns `true` for `"constructor"`, `"toString"`, `"__proto__"`, etc., because `in` checks the prototype chain, not just own properties (confirmed at `api/src/common/file.utils.ts:16-18`).
**Why it happens:** `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` is a plain object literal, so it inherits from `Object.prototype`.
**How to avoid:** `Object.hasOwn(ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES, normalized)` (Node 16.9+/ES2022; the project's Node 20+ baseline supports it natively) — exactly what the ROADMAP success criterion #5 specifies. Apply the same fix to `extensionFromMime` at line 9-14, which uses direct indexing (`ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES[normalized]`) — indexing does not have the same prototype-pollution risk as `in`, but the function should still route through the same allow-list check for consistency once centralized in `StorageService`.
**Warning signs:** A unit test asserting `isAllowedMimeType("constructor")` returns `false` is the direct regression check (already specified in the remediation doc's test list for lot L13).

## Code Examples

### Current same-version replay (no content comparison) — the bug
```typescript
// Source: api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts:318-326 (read directly, 2026-09-25)
if (syncVersion === existing.sync_version) {
  return {
    id: existing.id,
    server_status: "synced" as const,
    updated_at: existing.updated_at,
    warnings: draftValidation.warnings,
    factor_results: draftValidation.factor_results ?? undefined,
  }
}
```
Two more structurally identical call sites exist at lines 368-376 (submitted-survey replay path) and 467-475 (post-`UPDATE`-zero-rows re-read path) — all three must be updated together.

### Current MIME check (the bug)
```typescript
// Source: api/src/common/file.utils.ts:16-18 (read directly)
export function isAllowedMimeType(mimeType: string): boolean {
  return mimeType.trim().toLowerCase() in ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES
}
```

### Current profile-picture write (always local disk, regardless of mode) — the bug
```typescript
// Source: api/src/users/users.service.ts:142-146 (read directly)
const extension = extensionFromMime(mimeType)
const storageKey = `profiles/${user.id}/avatar${extension}`
const storagePath = this.storagePathForKey(storageKey)   // join(uploadsRootDir, key) — no S3 branch at all
await mkdir(dirname(storagePath), { recursive: true })
await writeFile(storagePath, file.buffer)
```

### Existing correct pattern to reuse for downloads (from Phase 01.5, D-01/D-18)
```typescript
// Source: api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts:455-477 (read directly)
private async buildDownloadUrl(storageKey: string, surveyId: string, attachmentId: string) {
  if (this.objectStorageMode === "minio" && this.s3Client) {
    await this.ensureS3Bucket()
    const command = new GetObjectCommand({ Bucket: this.s3Bucket, Key: storageKey })
    const url = await getSignedUrl(this.s3Client, command, { expiresIn: DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS })
    return { url, requires_auth: false }
  }
  return { url: `/surveys/${surveyId}/attachments/${attachmentId}/content`, requires_auth: true }
}
```
This branch-on-mode shape is exactly what `StorageService.getDownloadDescriptor()` should generalize for profile pictures too, replacing `users.controller.ts:71-79`'s always-local `StreamableFile` read.

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Three independent `new S3Client()` instantiations with drifted default buckets (`ibp-media` ×2, `ibp-surveys` ×1) | One `StorageService` | This phase | Removes ARCH-2's S3-instantiation duplication; single source of truth for bucket/mode |
| `(created_at, id)` cursor pagination on `survey_events` | `seq bigserial` + visibility delay, with legacy cursor still accepted | This phase | Closes the skip window; requires no mobile rebuild since the cursor stays an opaque string |
| Same-`sync_version` = automatic idempotent replay | Same-`sync_version` + content-hash match = replay; mismatch = `sync_version_conflict` | This phase | Two devices racing on the same survey now get an explicit, resolvable conflict instead of silent data loss |

**Deprecated/outdated:**
- The "fallback that re-sends event-less surveys on every poll" (`surveys-sync.service.ts:252-340`) is removed entirely once every mutation path reliably inserts a `survey_events` row — this is already true after Phase 01.4's transaction work (every upsert/patch/submit/delete path calls `insertEvent` inside the same transaction as the row mutation, confirmed by direct read of `surveys.service.ts` around lines 273, 389, 490, 676, 685, 732, 881, 923, 1016).

## Runtime State Inventory

> This phase is not a rename/refactor/migration of naming, but it does introduce a **data migration for existing production files** (profile pictures moving from local disk to MinIO) and a **schema migration** (survey_events.seq). Both are assessed below since they involve state outside the git repo.

| Category | Items Found | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Stored data (DB) | `survey_events` rows lack a `seq` column; existing rows need one assigned in insertion order | Migration: `ALTER TABLE survey_events ADD COLUMN seq BIGSERIAL`; Postgres backfills existing rows in physical/insertion order automatically as part of the `ADD COLUMN` (no separate UPDATE needed for a fresh `bigserial`) — verify order matches `(created_at, id)` order in a spot-check query before relying on it |
| Live service config | VPS `docker-compose.vps.yml` already runs a `minio` service with `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE: minio` set as the API's env (confirmed: `infra/docker-compose.vps.yml:29-48,70`) | None — MinIO is already the production object store for attachments; only profile pictures need to start using it |
| OS-registered state | None found — no systemd/task-scheduler references to storage paths | None |
| Secrets/env vars | `OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`/`OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`/`OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET`/`OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` already exist and are correctly wired for `minio` mode in prod (`infra/vps/env.example`) | None — code change only; no new env var needed unless the visibility-delay constant is made configurable (`SYNC_FEED_VISIBILITY_DELAY_SECONDS`, optional, can default in code) |
| Build artifacts / installed packages | None | None — no new packages, no rename |
| **Existing profile-picture files on the VPS filesystem** | **Owner action required.** Files currently live under `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR` (defaults to `/tmp/ibp-uploads`, i.e. **already ephemeral** — `/tmp` in a container with no declared volume, confirmed no volume mount for the `api` service in `docker-compose.vps.yml:47-77`) — meaning any profile picture uploaded since the last redeploy is **already lost** on every deploy today. This is the A-H3 finding itself. | A one-off migration script (or manual step) must check whether any profile pictures currently exist on the live filesystem at deploy time and, if so, copy them into MinIO under the new key scheme before the new code path goes live — but given `/tmp` is wiped on every container restart already, there is a real chance **nothing survives to migrate** by the time this phase ships. The plan must include a step to check this on the actual VPS before assuming a migration script has anything to do, and flag it as an **owner/operator action** (SSH to the VPS, inspect `/tmp/ibp-uploads/profiles/` inside the running container before deploying the new image). |

## Environment Availability

| Dependency | Required By | Available | Version | Fallback |
|------------|------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| PostgreSQL 16 | Migration, E2E tests | ✓ (local sandbox + CI service container + VPS) | 16 (pinned image) | — |
| MinIO | `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=minio` E2E/manual verification | ✓ locally via `infra/docker-compose.yml` (dev) and `infra/docker-compose.vps.yml` (prod); **✗ in CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` E2E job runs with `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE: local` only (confirmed lines 209-210) | `quay.io/minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z` | CI stays `local`-mode only for this phase; MinIO-mode behavior (presign enforcement, HeadObject size compare) must be verified locally against the dev-compose MinIO before merge, and/or a CI job change (out of this phase's scope, but the planner should note the gap) |
| `npm view` / registry checks | Package Legitimacy Gate | N/A — no new packages | — | — |

**Missing dependencies with no fallback:**
- None blocking. MinIO-mode E2E coverage in CI is a real gap (see Pitfall 2's testing note) but has a documented workaround (local verification + a note for Phase 01.7's CI work).

**Missing dependencies with fallback:**
- MinIO-mode automated testing in CI → verified manually / locally against `infra/docker-compose.yml`'s MinIO service before merge.

## Validation Architecture

### Test Framework
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework | Jest 29 + ts-jest (unit: `api/jest.unit.config.js`; E2E: `api/jest.config.js`) |
| Config file | `api/jest.unit.config.js` (unit), `api/jest.config.js` (E2E) |
| Quick run command | `npm run test:unit --workspace=api` (or `cd api && npx jest --config jest.unit.config.js <pattern>`) |
| Full suite command | `npm run test` (unit + E2E; E2E requires the `ibp_test` DB via Docker Compose) |

### Phase Requirements → Test Map
| Req ID | Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists? |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| REQ-AUD-changes-feed | Late-committed event is not skipped by a poller that already advanced its cursor | E2E (two real overlapping transactions, deliberately committed out of `seq`-acquisition order) | `cd api && npx jest --config jest.config.js sync-changes-ordering` (new file) | ❌ Wave 0 — new `api/test/sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts` |
| REQ-AUD-changes-feed | Old `(created_at,id)` cursor still accepted after the schema change | E2E | same new file, or extend `api/test/sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts` (already exists, exactly this purpose) | ✅ existing file to extend |
| REQ-AUD-changes-feed | Same `sync_version`, different content → `sync_version_conflict` | E2E | extend `api/test/surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts` (already exists) | ✅ existing file to extend |
| REQ-AUD-changes-feed | Event-less-survey fallback removed / no unbounded re-send | E2E | extend `api/test/sync-validation.e2e-spec.ts` or the new ordering spec | ✅ existing file to extend |
| REQ-AUD-object-storage | Path traversal (`surveyId = "../../x"`) rejected | Unit | `cd api && npx jest --config jest.unit.config.js storage.service` (new) | ❌ Wave 0 — new `api/src/storage/storage.service.spec.ts` |
| REQ-AUD-object-storage | `isAllowedMimeType("constructor")` → `false` | Unit | extend existing MIME test coverage (currently no dedicated `file.utils.spec.ts` found — confirmed by search) | ❌ Wave 0 — new `api/src/common/file.utils.spec.ts` or fold into `storage.service.spec.ts` |
| REQ-AUD-object-storage | Declared size ≠ actual uploaded size → 422, object deleted | E2E (MinIO mode, run locally/pre-merge; local mode covered separately) | extend `api/test/attachments-download.e2e-spec.ts` or new `attachments-upload-size.e2e-spec.ts` | ✅/❌ extend existing or new |
| REQ-AUD-object-storage | Profile picture survives "container restart" (i.e., is written via `StorageService` in minio mode, not local disk) | E2E | new `api/test/profile-picture-storage.e2e-spec.ts` | ❌ Wave 0 |

### Sampling Rate
- **Per task commit:** `npm run test:unit --workspace=api` (fast, no DB dependency for storage-service/hash-normalization unit tests)
- **Per wave merge:** `npm run test` (full unit + E2E against local `ibp_test` Postgres; MinIO-mode E2E run manually against `infra/docker-compose.yml` before merging the storage wave)
- **Phase gate:** Full suite green, plus a manual MinIO-mode check (upload → confirm → mismatch-422 → download) before `/gsd:verify-work`, given CI does not exercise `minio` mode.

### Wave 0 Gaps
- [ ] `api/test/sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts` — covers REQ-AUD-changes-feed's late-commit and legacy-cursor behavior
- [ ] `api/src/storage/storage.service.spec.ts` — covers path-traversal and MIME own-property checks
- [ ] `api/test/profile-picture-storage.e2e-spec.ts` — covers profile picture in object storage
- [ ] No new framework/config install needed — existing Jest setup covers all new test types

*(Coverage thresholds in `api/jest.unit.config.js` — `./src/surveys/` currently 48/36/39/48, `./src/users/` 69/46/47/69 — may only go up per prior-phase convention; the new `api/src/storage/` directory has no existing threshold row and should get one once its tests land.)*

## Security Domain

### Applicable ASVS Categories

| ASVS Category | Applies | Standard Control |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| V2 Authentication | no (unchanged in this phase) | — |
| V3 Session Management | no | — |
| V4 Access Control | yes | Existing `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2` ownership pattern must be preserved through the `StorageService` refactor — the service itself does not own authorization, callers still must check ownership before calling it |
| V5 Input Validation | yes | `@IsUUID()` on `:id`/`:attachmentId` route params (or a NestJS `ParseUUIDPipe`) before any value is interpolated into a storage key; `Object.hasOwn` MIME check |
| V6 Cryptography | no new crypto beyond `sha256` content hashing (Node built-in `crypto`, not a custom cipher) — not a V6 concern in the "never hand-roll crypto primitives" sense, since SHA-256 via Node's standard library is the correct tool, not a hand-rolled algorithm | Node `crypto.createHash("sha256")` |

### Known Threat Patterns for this stack

| Pattern | STRIDE | Standard Mitigation |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Path traversal via `:surveyId`/`:id` route param into a local-mode storage key | Tampering | `path.resolve()` + prefix-containment check (Pattern 3), plus `ParseUUIDPipe`/`@IsUUID` at the controller boundary as defense-in-depth |
| Prototype pollution / prototype-chain lookup bypass (`"constructor" in obj`) | Tampering | `Object.hasOwn()` instead of `in` |
| Declared-size-vs-actual-size mismatch enabling storage exhaustion / oversized uploads | Denial of Service | Presigned PUT `signableHeaders` content-length binding (best-effort, see Pitfall 2) + confirm-time `HeadObject` compare with delete-on-mismatch (authoritative) |
| Silent data loss from unresolved concurrent-write races (Case B) | Repudiation / Tampering (from the losing device's perspective, its write is silently discarded) | Content-hash comparison + explicit `sync_version_conflict` |

## Assumptions Log

| # | Claim | Section | Risk if Wrong |
|---|-------|---------|---------------|
| A1 | Adding `content-length` to `signableHeaders` on the AWS SDK v3 presigner will cause MinIO (pinned release) to reject a mismatched `Content-Length` with a signature error | Pitfall 2 / Pattern 1 alternatives | If wrong, the "presigned PUT enforces ContentLength" half of success criterion #4 cannot be achieved as described and the phase must rely solely on the confirm-time backstop, with the ROADMAP wording revisited during discuss-phase/planning |
| A2 | Current production `survey_events` table is small enough (hundreds–low thousands of rows) that a single-statement `ADD COLUMN ... BIGSERIAL` migration will not cause an unacceptable lock duration on the VPS | Pitfall 3 / Runtime State Inventory | If wrong (table is larger than assumed), the migration could hold an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock for an extended period during a production deploy window; the plan should verify actual row count on the VPS before executing, or use a two-step add-nullable-then-backfill-then-constrain approach |
| A3 | A visibility delay of ~10 seconds is a safe upper bound over the worst-case transaction hold time in `upsertForUser` (bounded by `CADASTRE_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` ≈ 2500ms plus normal query time) | Pattern 1 | If wrong (e.g., lock contention or a slow IGN response beyond its configured timeout under real network conditions extends a transaction past 10s), a late commit could still be skipped; the constant should be conservative and configurable, and the E2E test should exercise a deliberately-slow transaction near the delay boundary |
| A4 | No profile pictures currently need migrating because `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR` already defaults to an ephemeral, un-mounted path on the VPS (so anything uploaded is already lost on the next redeploy) | Runtime State Inventory | If wrong (e.g., an operator changed `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR` on the VPS to a path that happens to survive, or a volume was added out-of-band since this research), real user files could exist and need an actual copy-to-MinIO migration step that the plan must not skip |

**If this table is empty:** N/A — see entries above; all four require owner/operator confirmation before or during execution rather than blocking planning.

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

Resolved 2026-09-25, see 07-CONTEXT.md. Q1: visibility delay REPLACED by the transaction-snapshot filter (D-02). Q2: content hash computed on the fly (D-04). Q3: constants, not environment variables. Profile pictures: no recovery (D-06, owner). MinIO CI gap: closed by D-10.

1. **Visibility delay vs. txid/snapshot-based ordering — which does the owner want?**
   - What we know: both approaches close the "late commit skipped" gap; the delay approach is simpler to implement and test but trades a fixed latency window; the snapshot/txid approach is more rigorous but adds a new stored column and per-poll snapshot computation.
   - What's unclear: whether the field-survey sync latency tradeoff (events invisible to other devices for up to ~10s after commit) is acceptable to the product owner, versus investing the extra complexity for zero latency cost.
   - Recommendation: default to the visibility-delay approach (Pattern 1) for this phase given the "M"-sized lot budget in the remediation plan; document the delay constant prominently in `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` (success criterion #6) so it's an explicit, visible tradeoff, not a buried implementation detail.

2. **Where does the normalized content hash for Case B live — computed on read, or stored as a column?**
   - What we know: computing on-the-fly avoids a migration/backfill; storing it avoids repeated hashing work and makes the "what changed" comparison auditable in `survey_events` payloads.
   - What's unclear: whether a future phase (e.g., 01.7's `SurveysService` split) would benefit from a stored, indexed hash for other purposes.
   - Recommendation: compute on-the-fly for this phase (simplest, no migration risk) — revisit storing it only if profiling shows it matters.

3. **Should `SYNC_FEED_VISIBILITY_DELAY_SECONDS` be a real env var or a hardcoded constant?**
   - What we know: Phase 01.7 introduces `@nestjs/config` with a validated schema; adding a new ad-hoc `process.env` read in this phase adds to the very sprawl 01.7 is meant to clean up (the audit already counts "58 `process.env` accesses across 12 files").
   - What's unclear: whether the planner should pre-empt 01.7 by using `@nestjs/config` here, or keep it simple.
   - Recommendation: use a plain in-code constant (not a new env var) for this phase, with a comment pointing at Phase 01.7 as the place to formalize configuration; avoids adding to the pre-01.7 sprawl while still being trivially discoverable and changeable.

- Various MinIO GitHub issues about `SignatureDoesNotMatch` (via WebSearch) — establish that MinIO's SigV4 signature validation is strict and header-set-sensitive, but do not directly confirm the `content-length`-in-`signableHeaders` recipe works as intended; flagged in Assumption A1 for a required spike/verification step in the plan

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH — no new packages, versions read directly from `package.json`
- Architecture (StorageService shape, cursor compatibility): HIGH — derived directly from existing, already-proven download-branching code in this same codebase
- Architecture (visibility-delay ordering fix): MEDIUM — the underlying Postgres mechanics (nextval-at-execution vs. commit-time visibility) are well-established relational-database facts, but the specific delay-window recommendation is a design choice, not a verified external standard
- Pitfalls (presigned PUT ContentLength enforcement): LOW-MEDIUM — flagged explicitly as needing a verification spike against the pinned MinIO version before the plan treats it as solved
- Security domain: MEDIUM — ASVS mapping is straightforward for this phase's scope; no new authentication/session surface introduced

**Research date:** 2026-09-25
**Valid until:** 30 days (stable domain — Postgres/S3-SDK semantics do not change quickly; re-verify the MinIO ContentLength behavior specifically if this phase slips past that window, since it is the one genuinely unverified technical claim)
