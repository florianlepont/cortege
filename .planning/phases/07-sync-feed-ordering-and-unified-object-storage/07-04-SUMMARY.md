# Dependency graph
requires:
  - "01.6-02: StorageService / StorageModule (buildProfilePictureKey, putObject, headObject, getObject, deleteObject), own-property isAllowedMimeType"
provides:
  - "UsersService reads, writes and deletes profile pictures only through StorageService (bucket in minio mode, contained local path in local mode)"
  - "PUT /v1/me/profile-picture answers 400 for image/gif and prototype-key MIME types (never 500)"
  - "Stale-picture handling: GET /v1/me returns profile_picture_url null when the stored object is missing; GET /v1/me/profile-picture answers 404 and clears the profile_picture_* columns (key-conditional)"
  - "UsersModule imports StorageModule"
affects: [01.6 plan 05 (module wiring), 01.6 plan 08 (CI MinIO job runs the itMinio case), 01.6 plan 09 (docs)]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Object deletion after the DB write that stops referencing it (upload replace, remove, account deletion); deleteObject is best-effort"
    - "One HEAD per /me: only a confirmed missing object (null) hides the picture; other store errors are logged with Logger.warn and the stored URL is kept"
    - "Lazy stale-column clear on the read path with `AND profile_picture_storage_key = $2`, so a concurrent new upload is never wiped"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - api/src/users/users.service.ts
    - api/src/users/users.module.ts
    - api/test/users.service.spec.ts
    - api/test/auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts

key-decisions:
  - "uploadProfilePicture loads the user row before putObject, so a request for a missing user never writes an orphan object"
  - "removeProfilePicture now deletes the object after the UPDATE (it used to rm the file before), matching the DB-first order used by deleteAccount"
  - "getMe does not clear columns when the HEAD says missing; only the picture route does (plan: one HEAD per /me, no writes there)"
  - "getProfilePicture propagates storage errors other than a missing object (500), so an unreachable store never clears a valid picture"
  - "users.controller.ts left unchanged: the StreamableFile passthrough already matches D-15"

patterns-established:
  - "Services that own stored files inject StorageService as their last constructor parameter; unit specs pass a jest.fn() storage mock as the last argument instead of mocking fs/promises"

# Phase 01.6 Plan 04: Profile pictures on StorageService Summary

**Profile pictures now go through the shared `StorageService` (bucket in minio mode, so they survive a container restart), the picture route still streams bytes with Bearer auth, a missing object reads as "no picture" (null URL on `/me`, 404 plus column clear on the picture route), and `image/gif` or `constructor` uploads get a 400 instead of a 500.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 11 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T15:19:30Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T15:31:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- `UsersService` injects `StorageService` as its last constructor parameter. Its own S3 client, `"ibp-surveys"` bucket default, `storagePathForKey`, `cleanupAttachmentStorage` and the `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `fs/promises` and `path` imports are gone (D-05).
- `uploadProfilePicture` checks `isAllowedMimeType` on the trimmed, lower-cased type (400 "Unsupported profile picture type"), builds the key with `storage.buildProfilePictureKey`, writes with `storage.putObject`, and deletes a different previous key with `storage.deleteObject` only after the DB update succeeded (D-09, D-15).
- `getProfilePicture` reads with `storage.getObject`. On `null` it runs `UPDATE users SET profile_picture_url = NULL, profile_picture_storage_key = NULL, profile_picture_mime_type = NULL, updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1 AND profile_picture_storage_key = $2` and throws `NotFoundException` (D-06).
- `getMe` calls `storage.headObject` when a key is stored: `null` gives `profile_picture_url: null`; any thrown error is logged once with `Logger.warn` (error name and message, user id) and the stored URL is kept, so `/me` still answers 200 (T-01.6-15b).
- `removeProfilePicture` and `deleteAccount` use `storage.deleteObject` after the DB work; the A-M9 comment and ordering in `deleteAccount` are unchanged.
- `UsersModule` imports `StorageModule`. `GET /v1/me/profile-picture` still returns a `StreamableFile` with the stored Content-Type and `Cache-Control: private, max-age=60` (D-15, C-3).
- No migration of existing pictures (D-06).
- Coverage for `users.service.ts`: statements 99.11%, branches 91.48%, functions 93.33%, lines 100%.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: UsersService, controller and module on StorageService:** `e6ea9e7` (feat). The spec was updated first and failed to compile against the two-argument constructor (RED) before the service changed.
2. **Task 2: Profile-picture E2E in both storage modes:** `82dafcc` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/users/users.service.ts`: StorageService injection, MIME 400, stale-picture handling in `getMe` and `getProfilePicture`, post-DB object deletion, private `pictureObjectExists` helper
- `api/src/users/users.module.ts`: `imports: [AuthModule, StorageModule]`
- `api/test/users.service.spec.ts`: `fs/promises` mock dropped; storage mock as the last constructor argument; 42 cases (was 26), covering every behaviour bullet plus DB-failure cases (no object deletion when the UPDATE fails or finds no row) and the octet-stream fallback
- `api/test/auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts`: shared `login` / `uploadPicture` / `pictureColumns` helpers; new cases "rejects unsupported picture types with 400", "a missing stored picture reads as no picture", "replacing a picture removes the old object", and `itMinio("stores the picture in the bucket, not on local disk")`. The existing round-trip test is unchanged.

## Decisions Made

- The user row is loaded before `putObject`, so an unknown user never leaves an orphan object.
- `removeProfilePicture` deletes after the UPDATE (the old code removed the file first).
- `getMe` only hides the URL; the columns are cleared by the picture route, which already needs a DB round trip.
- Storage errors other than "missing" propagate from `getProfilePicture`, so an outage never clears a valid picture.
- The controller needed no change.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing correctness] No orphan object for an unknown user**
- **Found during:** Task 1
- **Issue:** the old flow wrote the file before checking that the user row exists, leaving an object behind on a 404.
- **Fix:** `findUserMeRow` runs before `putObject`; covered by "throws NotFoundException and writes nothing when the user is not found".
- **Files modified:** api/src/users/users.service.ts, api/test/users.service.spec.ts
- **Commit:** e6ea9e7

Other notes, not deviations:
- The plan's verify command runs E2E with inline env overrides; per the orchestrator's instructions the run used a wrapper script that exports the same variables as the scratchpad `e2e-env.sh` with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p04_test` (`ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-ibp_p04_test`), through `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`.
- The TDD task was committed as one commit (one commit per task, as the orchestrator required).

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree branch started at `3c242ce`, before plans 01 and 02 were merged; it was fast-forwarded to `44963d8` (the phase branch head containing both) before any work. No other branch was checked out.
- The root, `api` and `mobile` `node_modules` directories of the main checkout were symlinked in (untracked, not committed).
- MinIO is not available in the sandbox, so the `itMinio` case is skipped locally; it runs in the CI MinIO job (plan 08).

## User Setup Required

None. Existing profile pictures are not migrated (D-06, owner decision): users whose picture file is gone see the initials fallback after the next `/me`.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Verification green in this worktree:
  - `npm run lint` (exit 0), `npm run typecheck` (exit 0), `npm run format:check` (clean)
  - `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 17 suites, 287/287 tests, all thresholds met
  - Full E2E on `ibp_p04_test`, local mode: 14 suites, 92 passed, 1 skipped (the `itMinio` case), 93 total; `auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts` 10 passed, 1 skipped
- Plan 05 can wire modules knowing `UsersModule` already imports `StorageModule`. Plan 09 should update `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md` (profile picture: object storage, GET still streams via the API, 400 for unsupported types) and `data-contract-v1.md` (`profile_picture_storage_key` is an object storage key).
