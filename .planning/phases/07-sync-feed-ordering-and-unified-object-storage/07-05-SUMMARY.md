# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 07-sync-feed-ordering-and-unified-object-storage
    provides: "SAFE_ID_PATTERN / isSafeId (api/src/common/safe-id.ts) and StorageModule from plan 02"
provides:
  - "SafeIdPipe (api/src/common/safe-id.pipe.ts): 400 \"Invalid identifier\" for any route param outside SAFE_ID_PATTERN, the value never echoed"
  - "SafeIdPipe on all 16 :id / :attachmentId params of SurveysController"
  - "@Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN) on SurveyUpsertDto.id, SyncOperationEnvelopeDto.survey_id, SurveyDeletePayloadDto.id and AttachmentDeletePayloadDto.attachment_id, so /sync operations with unsafe ids fail alone with fatal_error 400 invalid_sync_operation"
  - "SurveysModule imports StorageModule, so plans 06 and 07 can inject StorageService"
  - "E2E proof under the production pipe (api/test/safe-ids.e2e-spec.ts)"

  patterns:
    - "Client-chosen ids are validated at the boundary twice: SafeIdPipe on route params, @Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN) on the DTOs that /sync reuses (it bypasses route pipes); StorageService key builders re-check as the last line"
    - "Boundary errors use fixed messages and never echo the rejected value"

key-decisions:
  - "SafeIdPipe implements PipeTransform<unknown, string> with the full (value, _metadata?) signature, so it can be used both by class reference in @Param and called directly in the unit spec"
  - "previous_survey_id is left unpatterned: it is a reference to an existing row, never a storage key segment (as the plan requires)"
  - "SyncOperationEnvelopeDto.survey_id keeps @MaxLength(128) next to @Matches; both agree on the 128 bound"

patterns-established:
  - "New controllers that take client-chosen ids use @Param(name, SafeIdPipe); DTO fields that can become storage keys carry @Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN)"

# Phase 01.6 Plan 05: Safe ids at the API boundary and StorageModule wiring Summary

**Every client-chosen survey and attachment id is checked against `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}$` at the boundary: `SafeIdPipe` on all 16 route params of the surveys controller and `@Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN)` on the four DTO fields that /sync uses. Unsafe ids get a 400 (or a per-operation `invalid_sync_operation` fatal_error on /sync), and no existing id format is rejected. `SurveysModule` now imports `StorageModule`.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min (first task commit 15:23:28Z, last task commit 15:25:00Z)
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T15:20:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T15:26:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (task 1 TDD)
- **Files modified:** 8 (3 created, 5 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `api/src/common/safe-id.pipe.ts`: `SafeIdPipe` returns the value when `isSafeId(value)` is true, otherwise throws `BadRequestException("Invalid identifier")`. The comment records the D-14 derivation (`survey-<Date.now()>` in early builds, `randomUUID()` today, server UUID attachment ids, `e2e-survey-<ms>` fixtures).
- `surveys.controller.ts`: all 12 `@Param("id")` and 4 `@Param("attachmentId")` now use `SafeIdPipe` (0 unpiped params left, 16 piped).
- DTOs: `@Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN)` after `@IsString()` on `SurveyUpsertDto.id`, `SyncOperationEnvelopeDto.survey_id` (the `@MaxLength(128)` is kept), `SurveyDeletePayloadDto.id` and `AttachmentDeletePayloadDto.attachment_id`. `previous_survey_id` and every other field are unchanged.
- `surveys.module.ts`: `imports: [AuthModule, StorageModule]`, no provider changes (D-05).
- Unit spec `api/test/safe-id.pipe.spec.ts` (13 cases): legacy, UUID, fixture-style and 128-char ids pass unchanged; `../x`, `a/b`, `a.b`, `""`, 129 chars, `undefined`, a number and a NUL-containing id throw `BadRequestException` with the message "Invalid identifier" and no echo of the value. `safe-id.pipe.ts` is at 100% coverage.
- E2E `api/test/safe-ids.e2e-spec.ts` (6 cases, production `configureApp(app)`):
  - `POST /v1/surveys` with `survey-<ms>` and with `randomUUID()` → 201, both readable with `GET` → 200, rows present.
  - `POST /v1/surveys` with `../../x`, `a.b`, 129 chars → 400, no row stored.
  - `GET /v1/surveys/a.b` → 400 with message "Invalid identifier" and no echo; `GET /v1/surveys/%2E%2E%2Fx` → 400 or 404 (never 200/500); `GET .../attachments/a.b/download-url` → 400; `DELETE .../attachments/a.b` → 400.
  - `/v1/sync` batch [attachment.create with `survey_id: "../x"`, survey.upsert with a legacy id, attachment.delete with `attachment_id: "../y"`, survey.delete with `id: "a/b"`] → HTTP 200, results [fatal_error 400 invalid_sync_operation, synced, fatal_error 400, fatal_error 400]; the valid survey is stored.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: SafeIdPipe, DTO patterns, controller params and StorageModule import:** `5cddd80` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Boundary E2E and no-regression run of every fixture:** `8154766` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/common/safe-id.pipe.ts`: new, `SafeIdPipe`
- `api/test/safe-id.pipe.spec.ts`: new, pipe unit spec
- `api/test/safe-ids.e2e-spec.ts`: new, boundary E2E
- `api/src/surveys/surveys.controller.ts`: `SafeIdPipe` on every `:id` / `:attachmentId`
- `api/src/surveys/dtos/survey-upsert.dto.ts`: `@Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN)` on `id`
- `api/src/surveys/dtos/sync-batch.dto.ts`: `@Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN)` on envelope `survey_id`
- `api/src/surveys/dtos/sync-payloads.dto.ts`: `@Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN)` on delete payload `id` and `attachment_id`
- `api/src/surveys/surveys.module.ts`: `StorageModule` import

## Decisions Made

- The pipe keeps the standard `transform(value, metadata)` shape (metadata unused, `_`-prefixed), so it matches `PipeTransform` exactly.
- The E2E also covers the survey.delete payload id and the attachment DELETE route, beyond the plan's listed cases, so each of the four patterned DTO fields and both route param names are exercised.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

Other notes, not deviations:
- The worktree branch started at the pre-execution base (`3c242ce`) without plans 01 and 02; it was fast-forwarded to `44963d8` (plan 02 complete) before starting, so `safe-id.ts` and `StorageModule` were present.
- Task 1 is TDD: the spec was written first and seen failing (module not found) before the pipe was implemented; both are in one commit, per the one-commit-per-task rule.

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree had no `node_modules`; the root, `api` and `mobile` `node_modules` directories of the main checkout were symlinked in (untracked, not committed).
- Sourcing the shared E2E env file was replaced by a scratchpad wrapper exporting the same variables with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p05_test` and `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p05`, run through `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plans 06 and 07 can inject `StorageService` into the surveys services without further module changes.
- Verification green in this worktree: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`, `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` (18 suites, 284/284 tests, all thresholds met), full API E2E on `ibp_p05_test` in local storage mode (15 suites, 95/95 tests, every existing fixture id still accepted). MinIO mode was not run (not available here).
