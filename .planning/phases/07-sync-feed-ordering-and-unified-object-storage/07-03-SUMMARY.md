    provides: "Migration 014 (survey_events.seq, survey_events.xid8, (xid8, seq) index, synthetic events) and parseSyncChangesCursor/buildSyncChangesCursor (plan 01)"
provides:
  - "GET /v1/sync/changes pages on (xid8, seq) below pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot()) and emits v2:<xid8>:<seq> cursors"
  - "Legacy <created_at>|<event or survey id> cursors translated with (created_at, id) <=; the translated v2 cursor is returned when nothing is new"
  - "Future-cursor guard: a v2 cursor at or past pg_snapshot_xmax restarts the feed (dump/restore safety)"
  - "Event-less survey fallback and its helpers removed; old parseChangesCursor/buildChangesCursor deleted"
  - "Real-transaction E2E proof that a late commit is never skipped (sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts)"

  patterns:
    - "Feed rows carry xid8/seq as text (SyncChangeEventRow) and are stripped before the response, so the public event shape is unchanged"
    - "Concurrency E2E: two PoolClients from DatabaseService.connect(), BEGIN + pg_current_xact_id() to fix xid order, rolled back and released in afterEach"
    - "Positive feed assertions poll briefly (100 ms steps) because the snapshot xmin is cluster-wide; negative assertions are checked once while the blocking transaction is open"

  - "The future-cursor warning logs the user id only, never the cursor value"
  - "parseSyncChangesCursor now rejects v2 values above the xid8 (2^64-1) or bigint (2^63-1) range with 400, instead of letting the SQL cast fail with a 500"

patterns-established:
  - "Commit-safety tests for any future feed or outbox: reproduce the early-xid/late-commit sequence with two raw clients rather than simulating it"

# Phase 01.6 Plan 03: Commit-safe changes feed Summary

**`GET /v1/sync/changes` now returns only events whose transaction has finished (`xid8 < pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())`), pages on `(xid8, seq)` and emits `v2:<xid8>:<seq>` cursors. It translates legacy `<timestamp>|<id>` cursors, restarts on a cursor from the future, and no longer re-sends event-less surveys. Two real overlapping transactions committed out of seq order prove that a late commit is never skipped.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** about 10 min (first task commit 15:22:07Z, last task commit 15:29:05Z)
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T15:19:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T15:32:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (task 1 TDD)
- **Files modified:** 8 (1 created, 7 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `getSyncChanges` (api/src/surveys/surveys-sync.service.ts):
  - Parses the cursor with `parseSyncChangesCursor`, then resolves a start position in a new `resolveSyncChangesStart`:
    - none → `("0", "0")`
    - legacy → the C-6 translation query (`(e.created_at, e.id) <= ($2::timestamptz, $3)`, scoped by `s.user_id = $1`, `ORDER BY e.xid8 DESC, e.seq DESC LIMIT 1`, falling back to `("0", "0")`)
    - position → the future guard `SELECT $1::xid8 >= pg_snapshot_xmax(pg_current_snapshot()) AS future`. If it is true, the feed restarts from `("0", "0")` and logs a warning with the user id.
  - The events query is exactly the PATTERNS C-1 shape. A comment above it explains why the snapshot filter plus `(xid8, seq)` ordering never skips an event, and that a long writer anywhere on the cluster only delays the feed.
  - `cursor_out` rules:
    - events returned → the v2 cursor of the last returned event
    - nothing new and no cursor → `null`
    - nothing new with a position cursor → the incoming cursor
    - nothing new with a legacy cursor → the translated v2 cursor
  - Deleted: the fallback branch, `loadSyncChangeSurveysWithoutEvents` and `loadSyncChangeAttachmentsBySurveyIds`. `loadSyncChangeSurveys` and `loadSyncChangeAttachmentsByIds` are kept.
- `parseChangesCursor`/`buildChangesCursor` are deleted from surveys-normalize.utils.ts, and nothing in api/src or api/test references them.
- 9 new `getSyncChanges` unit cases cover every behaviour bullet: SQL fragments and bindings, has_more/limit, v2 echo, legacy translation with and without a row, no fallback query, future guard true/false with the log check, and 400 on garbage.
- `sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts` has 4 cases on real PostgreSQL:
  - late commit with an early xid (eA visible with `cursor_out = v2:<xidA>:<seqA>` while eB is withheld; eB arrives once on the next poll and eA is not repeated)
  - withheld while an older writer is open (`cursor_out` equals the baseline, then eA before eB)
  - rolled-back writer leaves no gap
  - future cursor restarts the feed (all of the user's events in `(xid8, seq)` order, final cursor below the future value)
  - It passed 3 runs in a row.
- `sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts` gains a `legacy changes cursor` describe with an event-derived cursor, a survey-derived cursor (C-6), a cursor newer than every event (the translated v2 equals the user's last position), and a replay of the v2 cursor (stable).
- In `surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts`, the two fallback tests are replaced by `does not re-send event-less surveys on every poll`. It inserts a surveys row with no event, polls three times and never sees it. The feed test at the old :1467-1548 passes unchanged, so the cursor is still opaque.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: getSyncChanges on (xid8, seq) with snapshot filter, legacy translation, fallback removed**
   - `64eb9ef` (test): failing getSyncChanges specs and range rejections (11 failing)
   - `5e7dc1d` (feat): implementation, 61/61 in the two spec files
   - `84e6584` (style): Prettier line wrapping in the new spec
2. **Task 2: E2E proof that a late commit is never skipped:** `07f44af` (test)
3. **Task 3: Legacy-cursor compatibility and inversion of the fallback tests:** `6ddbd70` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/surveys/surveys-sync.service.ts`: rewritten `getSyncChanges`, new `resolveSyncChangesStart`, `FEED_START` constant, fallback helpers removed
- `api/src/surveys/surveys.types.ts`: `SyncChangeEventRow = SyncChangeEvent & { xid8: string; seq: string }` (internal)
- `api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts`: old cursor helpers deleted; the v2 range check was added
- `api/test/surveys-sync.service.spec.ts`: new `SurveysSyncService.getSyncChanges` describe (9 cases)
- `api/test/surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts`: 3 new out-of-range reject cases
- `api/test/sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts`: new, 4 cases
- `api/test/sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts`: `legacy changes cursor` describe, 3 cases
- `api/test/surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts`: 2 fallback tests replaced by 1 inverted test

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing validation] Out-of-range v2 cursor values caused a 500**
- **Found during:** Task 1
- **Issue:** `SYNC_CURSOR_V2_PATTERN` allows 20-digit xid8 and 19-digit seq values. Values such as `v2:99999999999999999999:1` or `v2:1:9223372036854775808` match the regex but overflow the `::xid8`/`::bigint` casts in the future guard and the events query. PostgreSQL then raises 22003 and the client gets a 500 instead of `400 Invalid sync cursor`.
- **Fix:** `parseSyncChangesCursor` compares both values with `BigInt` against 2^64-1 and 2^63-1 and throws the same `BadRequestException`. `2^64-1` and `2^63-1` themselves stay accepted (the existing plan 01 case). No `Number()` is used.
- **Files modified:** api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts, api/test/surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts
- **Commit:** 5e7dc1d (tests in 64eb9ef)

**2. [Acceptance grep] The literal `pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())` appears only in the SQL**
- The explanatory comment paraphrases the filter so that `grep -c` returns exactly 1, as the acceptance criterion requires. The E2E spec's `pg_current_xact_id()` count (4) comes from the helper plus one comment at each xid-acquisition step that explains the xid ordering.

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree started at `3c242ce`, before plans 01 and 02. I fast-forwarded it (`git merge --ff-only`) to `44963d8` from `claude/code-audit-complete-3sn99m`, which carries migration 014 and the cursor helpers. No branch switch was needed.
- `node_modules` is symlinked from the main checkout (root, api, mobile) and not committed.
- The shared e2e env file was not sourced. A scratchpad wrapper exports the same variables with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p03_test` and `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p03`, and runs `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock npm --workspace api run test:e2e`.

## Verification

- `npm run lint`: clean
- `npm run typecheck`: clean
- `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 17 suites, 283/283 passed, thresholds met (surveys-sync.service.ts 91.7% statements)
- Full `npm --workspace api run test:e2e` on `ibp_p03_test` (local object storage): 15 suites, 95/95 passed
- `sync-changes-ordering` alone: 3 consecutive green runs
- `npm run format:check` and Prettier on the 8 changed files: clean
- Acceptance greps:
  - `pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())`: 1
  - `ORDER BY e.xid8 ASC, e.seq ASC`: 1
  - `pg_snapshot_xmax(pg_current_snapshot())`: 1
  - the fallback helpers: 0
  - `parseChangesCursor|buildChangesCursor` in api/src and api/test: none
  - `Number(xid8|seq|lastEvent.xid8)`: 0
  - `legacy changes cursor`: 1
  - `it(.*fallback` in the idempotency spec: none
  - `does not re-send event-less surveys`: 1

## Threat Flags

None. The only new surface is the future-cursor guard query, which binds the cursor as `$1::xid8` (T-01.6-08) and is covered by T-01.6-11b.

## User Setup Required

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 08 can document the feed: snapshot rule, `(xid8, seq)` ordering, the `v2:` cursor, legacy translation, the cluster-wide xmin delay (C-11), and that a restore resets the xid counter, which the future guard handles by restarting the feed.
- Plans 06 and 07 do not touch `surveys-sync.service.ts`'s feed code. The event insert sites are unchanged because `seq`/`xid8` come from column defaults.
