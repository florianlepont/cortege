    provides: "StorageService (plan 02), safe ids at the boundary and StorageModule in SurveysModule (plan 05)"
provides:
  - "SurveysAttachmentsService on StorageService only: no S3 client, bucket, fs or path logic left in the file"
  - "Presigned attachment PUT signs Content-Length = size_bytes (presignPut(storageKey, mime, size_bytes))"
  - "Confirm/upload compares the stored size with size_bytes: 422 attachment_size_mismatch, object deleted (minio) or never written (local), uploaded_at stays NULL, no attachment_uploaded event"
  - "E2E api/test/attachments-upload-size.e2e-spec.ts: exact size accepted in both modes, local mismatch 422, MinIO-only signed-length 403 and confirm-time 422 + delete"
  - "E2E fixtures that upload now declare the byte length they upload; attachments-reports-transactions is mode-aware"

  - "size_bytes is compared with Number(...) so a string from the driver still matches"
  - "The content route maps StorageService's BadRequestException (key outside the upload root) to 404, keeping the documented 404 for traversal and missing files"
  - "Local uploads are written with the attachment's stored mime_type as content type"

patterns-established:
  - "Services never build storage keys or touch S3/fs themselves: buildAttachmentKey for keys, StorageService for every read, write, delete and presign"

# Phase 01.6 Plan 07: Attachments on StorageService with declared-size enforcement Summary

**`SurveysAttachmentsService` now goes through `StorageService` for every key, read, write, delete and presign. The presigned PUT signs `Content-Length = size_bytes`, and confirmation refuses a stored object whose size differs with `422 attachment_size_mismatch`, deleting it in MinIO mode and never writing it in local mode. The E2E fixtures that declared a size different from what they uploaded are corrected.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min (first task commit 15:37:35Z, last task commit 15:42:25Z)
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T15:31:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T15:45:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (task 1 TDD)
- **Files modified:** 5 (1 created, 4 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts`:
  - Constructor is `(db: DatabaseService, storage: StorageService)`. The config/S3 block, `buildUploadUrl`, `cleanupAttachmentStorage`, `ensureS3Bucket`, the local `DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS` copy (now imported from the storage service) and the S3, presigner, fs and path imports are gone. `grep -cE "S3Client|HeadObjectCommand|getSignedUrl|writeFile|readFile|join\(this.uploadsRootDir"` returns 0.
  - `createAttachment`: validation order unchanged; key from `storage.buildAttachmentKey(surveyId, attachmentId, mime)` (D-14); minio mode returns `storage.presignPut(storageKey, mime, size_bytes)` (D-08), local mode keeps the relative upload route.
  - `uploadAttachment`: minio mode calls `storage.headObject(key)`; null keeps the 400 "uploaded object not found in storage"; a length different from `Number(size_bytes)` calls `storage.deleteObject(key)` and throws `UnprocessableEntityException({ code: "attachment_size_mismatch", message: "Uploaded file size does not match declared size" })` before the transaction. Local mode keeps the required and 25 MB checks, then answers the same 422 on a length mismatch without writing, otherwise `storage.putObject(key, buffer, mime)`. The transaction and the `attachment_uploaded` event are unchanged; `object_storage_mode` comes from `storage.mode`.
  - `deleteAttachment` calls `storage.deleteObject` after commit. Downloads use `storage.presignGet` in minio mode; `getAttachmentContent` keeps minio → 404 and reads through `storage.getObject` (null or a key outside the upload root → 404).
- `api/test/surveys-attachments-download.spec.ts`: rewritten against a mocked `StorageService` passed as the last constructor argument; S3, presigner and fs mocks removed (plan 02's storage spec covers them). 20 cases: create (minio presign with 2048 and the built key; local relative route, no presign), upload (minio match, string size_bytes, mismatch → 422 + delete + no transaction, missing object → 400; local match → putObject, mismatch → 422 without putObject, missing file → 400; already uploaded short-circuit), delete after commit, the five existing download-url cases and four content cases. `surveys-attachments.service.ts` coverage: 86% statements, 69% branches.
- `api/test/attachments-upload-size.e2e-spec.ts` (new, 4 cases):
  1. Both modes: declare `JPEG_BYTES.length`, upload through the mode branch copied from `attachments-download.e2e-spec.ts`, 200, `uploaded_at` set, the download returns the same bytes.
  2. `itLocal`: declare N + 10, multipart N bytes → 422 `attachment_size_mismatch`, `uploaded_at` NULL, no file at `join(ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR, storage_key)`, no `attachment_uploaded` event.
  3. `itMinio`: declare N, presigned PUT of N + 10 bytes → 403, no object stored.
  4. `itMinio`: declare N, `storage.putObject(storage_key, Buffer.alloc(N + 10))`, PUT `confirm_url` → 422 `attachment_size_mismatch`, `storage.headObject` null, `uploaded_at` NULL, no event.
- `api/test/surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts`: the two uploading fixtures (REST create at ~1024, `/v1/sync` create at ~1329) use a named `uploadBytes` buffer and declare `uploadBytes.length`, in both the presigned and local branches. `size_bytes: (2048000|1024),` count went from 3 to 1 (the remaining one only creates).
- `api/test/attachments-reports-transactions.e2e-spec.ts`: the "injected failure leaves uploaded_at null" test declares the attached buffer's length; in minio mode it writes the object with `storage.putObject(storage_key, buffer)` and PUTs `confirm_url`, expecting the same 500 and NULL `uploaded_at`. Nothing else changed.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: SurveysAttachmentsService on StorageService with the size check:** `839dbee` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Size E2E in both modes and fixture corrections:** `48e3382` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts`: StorageService only, presigned Content-Length, 422 size check
- `api/test/surveys-attachments-download.spec.ts`: unit spec on a mocked StorageService
- `api/test/attachments-upload-size.e2e-spec.ts`: new, size enforcement E2E (local + MinIO-only cases)
- `api/test/surveys-idempotency.e2e-spec.ts`: uploading fixtures declare their real size
- `api/test/attachments-reports-transactions.e2e-spec.ts`: real declared size, mode-aware upload

## Decisions Made

- The content route translates StorageService's 400 for a key outside the upload root into the documented 404, so the previous traversal behaviour (404, no read) is preserved.
- The MinIO signed-length case also asserts that no object was stored, which is the observable effect of the 403.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written.

Other notes, not deviations:
- The unit spec covers a few cases beyond the behaviour list (string `size_bytes`, local missing file, already-uploaded short-circuit, delete after commit).
- The local-only E2E case uses an `itLocal` helper (`OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE !== "minio" ? it : it.skip`), the guard the plan describes.
- Task 1 is TDD: the spec was written first and seen failing (constructor arity TS2554) before the service was changed; both are in one commit, per the one-commit-per-task rule.
- The MinIO cases (3, 4 and the minio branch of the reports-transactions test) were not run here (MinIO unavailable); they follow the existing mode branch of `attachments-download.e2e-spec.ts` and the `itMinio` helper of `auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts`, and run in the CI MinIO pass (plan 08).

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree branch started behind; it was fast-forwarded to `claude/code-audit-complete-3sn99m` (plans 01 to 05 present).
- `node_modules` (root, `api`, `mobile`) were symlinked from the main checkout, untracked and not committed.
- E2E ran through a scratchpad wrapper exporting the shared E2E env with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p07_test`, `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=local` and `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p07`, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 08 can run the repo-wide single-S3-client check once plan 06 lands; the CI MinIO pass will exercise the two `itMinio` cases here.
- Verification green in this worktree: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`, `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` (18 suites, 323/323 tests, all thresholds met), full API E2E on `ibp_p07_test` in local mode (17 suites, 106 passed, 3 skipped = the MinIO-only cases, 109 total).
