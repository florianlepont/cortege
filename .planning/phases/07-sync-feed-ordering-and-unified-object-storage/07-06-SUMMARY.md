# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 07-sync-feed-ordering-and-unified-object-storage
    provides: "StorageService (plan 02), migration 014 column defaults for survey_events (plan 01), StorageModule import in SurveysModule (plan 05)"
provides:
  - "classifySameVersionContent(body, existing, existingParcelIds) → identical | visibility_only | conflict (api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts)"
  - "Same-sync_version rule at all three upsert sites: identical → synced, visibility-only → applied like visibility_update and synced, read-only difference → 409 sync_version_conflict"
  - "SurveysService without its own S3 client; survey-deletion cleanup through StorageService.deleteObject after commit"
  - "E2E proof: api/test/surveys-same-version.e2e-spec.ts (10 cases, REST and /v1/sync, mode-aware delete cleanup)"

key-decisions:
  - "The three sites call classifySameVersionContent inline and hand the result to one private resolveSameVersionUpsert, so the conflict/visibility/replay logic has a single copy"
  - "applyVisibilityChange was extracted and patchSurveyVisibility now uses it; its guards, SQL, event payload ({from, to}) and responses are unchanged"
  - "patchSurveyVisibility has no status guard, so a visibility-only retry is applied to submitted surveys too; on a soft-deleted row it is answered synced with no UPDATE and no event"
  - "On a submitted survey, a same-version resend with a changed read-only field now gets sync_version_conflict (the same-version check runs before the submitted read-only check, as the plan orders it)"

patterns-established:
  - "Services never own an S3 client: object I/O goes through StorageService"

# Phase 01.6 Plan 06: Same-version content rule and SurveysService storage through StorageService Summary

**An upsert that carries the sync_version the server already stored is a replay only when its content matches by value. If only visibility differs, the change is applied last-writer-wins like `visibility_update` and answered `synced`. Any read-only difference gets a 409 `sync_version_conflict` at all three call sites. `SurveysService` no longer owns an S3 client, and survey deletion cleans attachment objects through `StorageService` after commit.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 10 min (first task commit 15:35:01Z, last task commit 15:41:27Z)
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T15:32:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T15:45:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (task 1 TDD)
- **Files modified:** 4 (1 created, 3 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `surveys-normalize.utils.ts`: new `SameVersionContent` type and `classifySameVersionContent`. It returns "conflict" when `getChangedSubmittedReadOnlyFields` reports a field. Otherwise it returns "visibility_only" when `(body.visibility ?? existing.visibility) !== existing.visibility`, and "identical" in every other case. There is no hashing and no stored column. The comment explains the rationale: JSONB reorders keys, and visibility is last-writer-wins.
- Unit spec: 11 new cases covering every behaviour bullet: identical, factor key order, parcel order and case, site_name, one factor value, parcel set, visibility only, visibility absent, read-only plus visibility, excluded scores/status/expires_at, and null or absent fields.
- `surveys.service.ts`:
  - `classifySameVersionContent(` is called at site 1 (existing row), site 2 (submitted path re-read) and site 3 (draft path re-read). Sites 2 and 3 load `getSurveyParcelIds(db, reRead.id)`.
  - `resolveSameVersionUpsert` handles the three outcomes:
    - conflict: throws `ConflictException` with code `sync_version_conflict` and message "Same sync_version with different content", plus survey_id and the server/client versions.
    - visibility_only: applies the change through `applyVisibilityChange` and returns the new `updated_at`, but only when the row is not soft-deleted.
    - Otherwise it returns the stored `updated_at`.
  - Order at site 1 stays the same: older-version conflict, then the same-version check, then the submitted read-only logic.
  - The S3 fields, the constructor S3 block, `cleanupAttachmentStorage` and the `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `fs/promises` and `path` imports are removed. `private readonly storage: StorageService` is now the last constructor parameter. The post-commit loop calls `this.storage.deleteObject(storageKey)` and keeps the "best-effort, only after commit" comment.
- E2E `api/test/surveys-same-version.e2e-spec.ts` runs 10 cases under production `configureApp`:
  - (1) identical replay → 201 synced
  - (2) site_name changed → 409 `sync_version_conflict` with details; row unchanged
  - (3) visibility only → 201 synced; visibility public, `updated_at` moved forward and equal to the response, one visibility_changed event, sync_version still 1
  - (3b) /v1/sync installed-app retry → synced and applied
  - (3c) visibility and site_name changed → 409; neither field changed and no event
  - (3d) soft-deleted row → synced; visibility and `updated_at` unchanged, no event
  - (4) factor keys and parcel ids re-ordered → synced
  - (5) /v1/sync batch → [fatal_error 409 `sync_version_conflict` with details, synced]
  - (6) submitted survey with a changed factor at the same version → 409; row unchanged
  - (7) delete → `storage.headObject(storage_key)` goes from non-null to null, using the mode-aware upload branch

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Same-version content classification helper:** `8220fcc` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Three sites and StorageService in SurveysService:** `09c89da` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Same-version and deletion-cleanup E2E:** `dcdb41b` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts`: `SameVersionContent`, `classifySameVersionContent`
- `api/test/surveys-normalize.utils.spec.ts`: classification cases
- `api/src/surveys/surveys.service.ts`: three same-version sites, `resolveSameVersionUpsert`, `applyVisibilityChange`, StorageService injection, S3 removal
- `api/test/surveys-same-version.e2e-spec.ts`: new E2E

## Decisions Made

- One copy of the same-version logic (`resolveSameVersionUpsert`). The acceptance grep still finds three `classifySameVersionContent(` calls because each site classifies against its own row.
- `applyVisibilityChange` was extracted and is shared with `patchSurveyVisibility`. That route's early "unchanged" return and its `getSurveyForUserOrThrow` guard stay in the route. Only the UPDATE and event moved.
- In case (6), the code is `sync_version_conflict`, because the same-version check precedes the submitted read-only check. The test accepts either code, as the plan allows.

## Deviations from Plan

None in the plan's files. One out-of-scope consequence is left for the orchestrator (see Issues Encountered).

Other notes, not deviations:
- Task 1 is TDD: the spec was written first and failed (export missing) before the helper existed. Both are in one commit, following the one-commit-per-task rule used by plan 05.

## Issues Encountered

- **Existing E2E asserts the old Case B behaviour (not fixed, outside files_modified).** `api/test/surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` › "never 500s and converges on one sync_version for two concurrent upserts at the same sync_version" sends two concurrent /v1/sync upserts at sync_version 2 with *different* site names. It then expects neither to be `fatal_error`. That is the silent overwrite D-04 removes: the loser now correctly gets `fatal_error` 409 `sync_version_conflict`, so this one test fails. No plan in this phase lists the file. A verified fix exists: exactly one synced and one fatal_error `sync_version_conflict`/409, sync_version 2, the winner's site_name stored, one `updated` event. With it applied, all 8 tests in the file pass. It was saved outside the repo and the file was restored unchanged, because this plan may only edit its files_modified.
- The worktree had no `node_modules`, so the root, `api` and `mobile` directories were symlinked from the main checkout (untracked, not committed).
- The E2E ran through a scratchpad wrapper that exports the shared E2E env with `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_p06_test` and `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-p06`, under `flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock`. MinIO mode was not run because MinIO is not available here.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 08 can document the same-version rule (identical → synced, visibility-only → applied, read-only difference → 409) in `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` and `api-contract-v1.md`.
- Before merge, the `surveys-transactions` concurrent-upsert assertion must be updated as described above.
- Verification in this worktree:
  - `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run format:check` pass.
  - `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage`: 18 suites, 323/323 tests, thresholds met.
  - Full API E2E on `ibp_p06_test` in local mode: 17 suites, 113 passed, 1 skipped, 1 failed (the `surveys-transactions` test above). `surveys-idempotency` (including :48-92) and `sync-installed-app-compat` pass, and the new suite passes 10/10.
