# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 07-sync-feed-ordering-and-unified-object-storage
    provides: "Commit-safe feed and v2 cursor (plans 01, 03), StorageService (02), profile pictures (04), safe ids (05), same-version rule (06), attachment size enforcement (07)"
provides:
  - "CI job `e2e-minio` (\"E2E tests — API (MinIO mode)\"): full E2E suite with OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=minio against pinned MinIO, required by CI OK"
  - "Contract, conflict, data and architecture docs describing what plans 01-07 shipped"

  - "ROADMAP Phase 01.6 criterion 1 names the (xid8, seq) order"

  patterns:
    - "Services a GitHub service container cannot start (MinIO needs `server /data`) run from a `docker run` step followed by a bounded health-wait loop that dumps `docker logs` on timeout"

key-decisions:
  - "The MinIO bucket is not pre-created in CI: StorageService creates it lazily (HeadBucket, then CreateBucket), so the job also proves the production code path"
  - "e2e-minio runs the suite once (no sentinel/second run); the reset proof stays in the local-mode e2e job, which is unchanged"
  - "Docs describe the shipped deviations: out-of-range v2 cursors are 400 (plan 03); a same-version resend that changes a submitted survey gets sync_version_conflict because that check runs first, and two concurrent same-version upserts give one synced and one 409 (plan 06); the content route maps storage-path errors to 404 and a size mismatch is 422 attachment_size_mismatch (plan 07)"

patterns-established:
  - "Contract docs state the size rule for presigned uploads: size_bytes must be the exact uploaded length"

# Phase 01.6 Plan 08: MinIO-mode CI job and contract docs Summary

**CI now runs the full API E2E suite a second time against a real, pinned MinIO (`e2e-minio`), and CI OK fails when that job fails. The contract, conflict-resolution, data and architecture docs now describe the `(xid8, seq)` changes feed with its opaque `v2:` cursor, the same-version rule (B1/B2/B3), safe ids, signed `Content-Length` with `422 attachment_size_mismatch`, and profile pictures in object storage. Operators get a documented post-restore `UPDATE survey_events SET xid8 = pg_current_xact_id()` procedure.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** about 20 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T15:46:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T16:06:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, new job `e2e-minio` ("E2E tests — API (MinIO mode)"), placed after `e2e`:
  - Same `runs-on`, `timeout-minutes: 20`, `needs: changes`, path-filter `if` (api or shared) and postgres:16 service as `e2e`.
  - Same env as `e2e` except `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE: minio` plus `OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT: http://localhost:9000`, `OBJECT_STORAGE_REGION: us-east-1`, `OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY: minio`, `OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY: minio123`. `OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET: ibp-media` and `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR` are kept (the profile test uses the latter to prove nothing is written locally).
  - Steps: the same SHA-pinned checkout, setup-node and cache steps, `npm ci` on cache miss, "Start MinIO" (`docker run -d --name minio -p 9000:9000 ... quay.io/minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z server /data`, same tag as `infra/docker-compose.yml`), "Wait for MinIO" (30 × 2 s on `/minio/health/live`, `docker logs minio` and exit 1 on timeout), "E2E run (MinIO mode)" (`npm run test:e2e`).
  - The E2E env loader (`api/test/e2e-env.js`) uses dotenv with `override: false`, so the job env wins. The specs pick their mode from `process.env.OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE === "minio"` (`itMinio`/`itLocal` in `auth-profile`, `attachments-upload-size`; the mode branch in `attachments-reports-transactions`), so this job runs the MinIO-only cases and skips the local-only one.
  - `ci-ok`: `e2e-minio` added to `needs`, `E2E_MINIO_RESULT: ${{ needs.e2e-minio.result }}`, an echo line, and `"$E2E_MINIO_RESULT"` in the success-or-skipped loop. The `e2e` job is untouched.
- `docs/technical/sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md`:
  - Case B is split into B1 (identical → synced), B2 (visibility only → applied like `visibility_update`, synced) and B3 (read-only difference → 409 `sync_version_conflict`). It names the compared and excluded fields, the submitted-survey ordering and the concurrent-upsert outcome.
  - New attachment size-mismatch rule.
  - New "Changes Feed Ordering" section (position columns, snapshot rule, cluster-wide delay, cursor and legacy translation, 400 on out-of-range values, future-cursor guard, removed fallback) and a "Database restore" subsection with the exact SQL.
- `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md`:
  - `GET /sync/changes`: opaque `v2:<xid8>:<seq>` cursor, stored and replayed verbatim; legacy form still accepted; `cursor_out` rules; 400 `Invalid sync cursor`; new example cursors.
  - Same-version rule on `POST /surveys` and in `/sync` rules; identifier rule.
  - Attachment create: exact `size_bytes`, signed `Content-Length`, 403 from the store. The upload/confirm route documents `422 attachment_size_mismatch` and the deletion. The content route answers 404 for escaping keys.
  - Profile picture: object storage, 400 for unsupported types, bytes streamed with Bearer auth, 404 plus column clear when the object is missing, `/me` null URL.
  - `sync_version_conflict` and `attachment_size_mismatch` added to the error codes; example bucket `ibp-surveys` → `ibp-media`.
- `docs/technical/data-contract-v1.md`:
  - `profile_picture_storage_key` is an object storage key.
  - Safe-id design rule, attachment key format and size note.
  - The existing Survey Event section gains `seq`, `xid8`, the unique `(xid8, seq)` index, `backfilled` events and the restore note.
- `docs/technical/technical-architecture-v1.md`: one `StorageService` owns object storage (profile pictures included); the upload flow mentions the signed `Content-Length` and the confirm-time size check.
- `CLAUDE.md`: `storage` row in the API module table and `api/src/storage/storage.service.ts` in Key files. Nothing else changed.
- `infra/vps/README.md`: "Restoring the database" section (stop the timer and the API, run the `UPDATE` through `docker compose ... exec postgres psql`, restart). The bucket note now says the API creates the bucket on first use.
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`: only Phase 01.6 success criterion 1 was reworded.

## Decisions Made

See `key-decisions` in the frontmatter.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Stale doc] Drifted bucket name and "bucket must exist" note**
- **Found during:** Task 2
- **Issue:** the contract's presigned URL examples used the old `ibp-surveys` bucket, and `infra/vps/README.md` said the bucket must be created by hand. StorageService now defaults to `ibp-media` and creates the bucket on first use.
- **Fix:** examples use `ibp-media`; the README says the API creates the bucket (manual creation still possible).
- **Files modified:** docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md, infra/vps/README.md
- **Commit:** ca0ada0

Other notes, not deviations:
- The body-level safe-id rejection on `POST /surveys` is a normal class-validator 400, not the pipe's "Invalid identifier" message, and the contract says so.
- The "CI" section of CLAUDE.md was left as is (the plan limits CLAUDE.md to the module table and Key files).

## Issues Encountered

- The worktree started behind; it was fast-forwarded (`git merge --ff-only claude/code-audit-complete-3sn99m`) with no branch switch.
- `node_modules` (root, `api`, `mobile`) are symlinked from the main checkout, untracked and not committed.
- MinIO cannot run in this sandbox, so the new job was validated statically; plan 09's PR CI run is the runtime proof.

## Verification

- Plan python check on ci.yml: `ci ok`. A second script checked that `e2e` and `e2e-minio` have identical `runs-on`, `timeout-minutes`, `needs`, `if`, `services` and first four steps, and that the env differs only in `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE` and the four new `OBJECT_STORAGE_*` keys.
- actionlint v1.7.12 (the checksum-verified release the `check` job uses) on `.github/workflows/*.yml`: clean.
- `grep -c "needs.e2e-minio.result"`: 1. Unpinned `uses:` in the new job: 0.
- `grep -rln "new S3Client" api/src`: exactly `api/src/storage/storage.service.ts`. There are none in `api/test`, `api/scripts` or `mobile/src`.
- Plan docs verify: `docs ok`. `{timestamp}|{event_id}` in api-contract: 0. "local storage key" in data-contract: 0.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`: all pass.

## User Setup Required

None. After any future logical restore of the production database, follow "Restoring the database" in `infra/vps/README.md`.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 09's PR CI run must show `E2E tests — API (MinIO mode)` green (it runs the `itMinio` cases of `auth-profile` and `attachments-upload-size`, and the MinIO branch of `attachments-reports-transactions`), with CI OK depending on it.
