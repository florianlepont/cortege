# Phase 01.6 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | Jest 29 + ts-jest (API unit specs in `api/test/*.spec.ts`); Jest + Supertest E2E against PostgreSQL 16 (`api/test/*.e2e-spec.ts`, reset by `api/test/global-setup.js`, `*_test` databases only) |
| **Config file** | `api/jest.unit.config.js` (unit, coverage ratchet), `api/jest.config.js` (E2E) |
| **Quick run command** | `npm --workspace api run test:unit -- <spec-name>` |
| **Full suite command** | `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test:unit && npm run format:check`, plus `POSTGRES_DB=ibp_pNN_test OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=local ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/ibp-uploads-pNN flock /tmp/ibp-e2e.lock npm --workspace api run test:e2e` (one dedicated database per plan, serialized by the lock because the snapshot xmin is cluster-wide and parallel runs would make the feed tests flaky, `pg_ctlcluster 16 main start`, role `ibp`/`ibp`) |
| **MinIO mode** | Not available in the sandbox. Proven only by the CI job "E2E tests — API (MinIO mode)" (plan 08) on the phase PR (plan 09). Local runs report `itMinio` cases as skipped |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~60 s unit; ~3-5 min E2E per mode |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** the task's `<automated>` command (targeted unit spec, or E2E on the plan's own `_test` database)
- **After every plan wave:** full suite command, including the full E2E suite on the plan's database
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** local gate green (plan 09 Task 1), and the phase PR's CI green with both E2E jobs (local mode twice, MinIO mode once)
- **Max feedback latency:** 120 seconds (unit); one E2E run for DB and storage behaviour

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions | Result |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Two devices stay in sync; a photo uploads with the signed Content-Length; a profile picture displays and survives an API restart | both | Needs real devices (DEV build) and the deployed VPS after merge | Plan 09 Task 3 steps 2-6 | ✅ green (simulated, see below) |

---

### Owner check: done by Claude (2026-09-25)

The owner asked Claude to run the device checks for the audit phases instead of testing on the phone. The PR merged as 1a487d2, and the main CI run [36159558295](https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36159558295) is green and published the image. Production `/v1/health` answers 200. Production itself cannot be exercised without an Auth0 login, so the owner steps were replayed against the built API (`node dist/main.js`) from main at 1a487d2. The setup:

- **Storage:** `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=minio`, backed by a local `pgsty/minio` container that uses the same pinned digest as CI.
- **Database:** a freshly migrated database, `ibp_verify16`.
- **Script:** `07-owner-check-simulation.mjs`.
- **Devices:** two sessions on the same account act as device A and device B.

| Owner step | Simulated check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 3. Rename on A appears on B | A upserts v1 through `/sync`. B pulls and gets a `v2:` cursor. A renames (v2). B pulls from its cursor and sees the new name. The next pull is empty, so nothing is re-sent. A legacy cursor is still accepted and is answered with a `v2:` cursor. | ✅ |
| (D-04/D-16) | Same-version retry that only changes visibility returns `synced`. Same version with a different site name returns `fatal_error` `sync_version_conflict`. | ✅ |
| 4. Photo on a draft | A presigned PUT to MinIO returns 200, confirm returns 200, and B's `download-url` returns identical bytes. A declared size of 500000 on a 2 KB body gets 403 from MinIO. | ✅ |
| 5. Profile picture | Upload returns 200. `/me` has `profile_picture_url`, and `GET /me/profile-picture` serves `image/png`. | ✅ |
| 6. Survives API restart | After the API process was stopped and restarted, `/me` still has the picture, its bytes are still served, and the survey photo is still downloadable. | ✅ |

The result is 20/20 checks (17 in phase 1, 3 in phase 2). The full E2E suite was also run locally in MinIO mode against the same container: 18 suites, 118 passed and 1 skipped (local-only).

The limit of this check: it exercises the API a device talks to, not the phone UI. This phase changes no mobile code, and the mobile unit suite (757/757) covers the client side of the opaque cursor.

## CI Evidence (plan 09, Task 2)

The orchestrator gathered this evidence from GitHub, because the executor sandbox cannot reach GitHub. Plan 09 recorded it here.

- PR: https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/pull/154 (draft, base `main`)
- CI run: https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36157669303 (head `38ade7c`), fully green
- CodeQL: "CodeQL analysis" green on the same head

| Job | Conclusion |
|-----|------------|
| Detect changed paths | success |
| Lint, format, typecheck | success |
| Unit tests — API | success (no coverage threshold failure) |
| Unit tests — Mobile | success |
| E2E tests — API (local mode: run 1, sentinel, run 2, reset assertion) | success |
| E2E tests — API (MinIO mode) | success |
| Mobile build check | success |
| Dependency audit | success |
| Docker image check | success |
| CodeQL analysis | success |
| CI OK | success |
| Build & push Docker image | skipped (runs on main only) |

MinIO-mode E2E job result, as reported from the job log: 18 suites passed; 118 tests passed, 1 skipped, 119 total.

The one skipped case is the `itLocal` case ("rejects a local upload whose size differs from the declared size"). Every `itMinio` case ran and passed:

- `attachments-upload-size` › "presigned PUT enforces the signed Content-Length": MinIO answers 403 to a body whose size differs from the signed size
- `attachments-upload-size` › "confirm rejects and deletes an object whose size differs": 422, and the object is deleted
- `auth-profile` › "stores the picture in the bucket, not on local disk"

**D-08 fallback: not needed.** MinIO enforced the signed Content-Length. Criterion 4 therefore rests on the presigned signature, and the 422 check at confirm is a second layer.

**MinIO image.** The first MinIO-mode run failed before any test ran. `quay.io/minio/minio` answers 401, and `minio/minio` no longer exists on Docker Hub because upstream MinIO OSS is archived. The owner chose the maintained `pgsty/minio` fork, pinned by digest, in commit `eec885c`. A STATE todo tracks moving the local and VPS compose files to the same image.

**Wave 3 adaptation.** The orchestrator adapted `api/test/surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts`, which is outside plan 06's files, to the D-04 rule. Two concurrent upserts at the same version with different content now give one `synced` result and one `fatal_error` 409 `sync_version_conflict`.

### Local gate (plan 09 Task 1, 2026-09-25, integrated head `38ade7c` plus the ratchet)

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `npm run lint` | exit 0, 0 warnings |
| `npm run typecheck` | exit 0 |
| `npm --workspace api run test:unit:coverage` | 18 suites, 334 tests passed; thresholds met before and after the ratchet |
| `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` | 57 suites, 757 tests passed |
| `npm run format:check` | all files formatted |
| Tracked-file prettier (287 files) | all files formatted |
| Full E2E on `ibp_p09_test`, local mode, run 1 | 18 suites passed; 116 passed, 3 skipped (the `itMinio` cases) |
| Full E2E on `ibp_p09_test`, local mode, run 2 | 18 suites passed; 116 passed, 3 skipped |
| `sync-changes-ordering`, 3 extra runs | 4/4 passed each time |

**Coverage ratchet.** Values are the floors printed by `node scripts/coverage-by-directory.js api`, as statements/branches/functions/lines:

| Directory | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `./src/common/` | 76/71/37/79 | 88/90/60/87 |
| `./src/surveys/` | 48/36/39/48 | 56/41/51/56 |
| `./src/users/` | 69/46/47/69 | 74/56/51/74 |

Global, `./src/auth/`, `./src/database/`, `./src/debug/`, `./src/reports/` and `./src/storage/` measured the same as their thresholds, so they are unchanged. No value was lowered, and the ratchet check printed `ratchet ok`.
