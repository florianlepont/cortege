# Phase 01.6: Sync feed ordering and unified object storage Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** No change is ever skipped or silently dropped between devices, and every stored file lives in object storage behind one service that bounds what it accepts.
**Verified:** 2026-09-25T16:33:39Z
**Status:** passed (one non-blocking warning, see Anti-Patterns)
**Re-verification:** No, initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (Roadmap Success Criteria)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `/v1/sync/changes` pages on `survey_events` `(xid8, seq)`, filtered by `xid8 < pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())`, still accepts the old `(created_at, id)` cursor, and a late-committed event is never skipped (E2E) | ✓ VERIFIED | `api/migrations/014_survey_events_seq_xid8.sql` backfills `seq` with `row_number() OVER (ORDER BY created_at, id)`, sets NOT NULL, adds identity, `setval(MAX+1, false)`, adds `xid8 NOT NULL DEFAULT pg_current_xact_id()` and a unique index on `(xid8, seq)`. It inserts one `backfilled` event per owned survey that has none, after `setval`. `surveys-sync.service.ts::getSyncChanges` filters `(e.xid8, e.seq) > ($2::xid8, $3::bigint) AND e.xid8 < pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())`, orders by `xid8, seq` and emits `v2:<xid8>:<seq>`. Both values stay strings. `resolveSyncChangesStart` translates legacy cursors with `(created_at, id) <= cursor`, which covers the survey ids the old fallback emitted. It falls back to the feed start when nothing matches. Its future-cursor guard (`$1::xid8 >= pg_snapshot_xmax(...)`) restarts the feed and logs the user id, not the cursor. `parseSyncChangesCursor` returns 400 for `v2:` values above 2^64-1 or 2^63-1, for any other `v2:` shape and for `seq:5`. I checked this directly against the built module. `sync-changes-ordering.e2e-spec.ts` holds two real transactions, B committing before A with `xidA < xidB`. It asserts that A is returned and B is withheld, then B is returned exactly once. It also covers an event withheld while an older writer is open, a rolled-back writer and a future cursor. `sync-installed-app-compat.e2e-spec.ts` covers event-derived and survey-derived legacy cursors and the `v2:` translation. `migration-014-survey-events-seq.e2e-spec.ts` runs the migration on seeded pre-migration rows. All pass locally. |
| 2 | Same `sync_version` with different content gives `sync_version_conflict` instead of a silent replay; the fallback that re-sent event-less surveys on every poll is gone | ✓ VERIFIED | `classifySameVersionContent` (`surveys-normalize.utils.ts`) reuses the value-based `getChangedSubmittedReadOnlyFields` and returns `conflict`, `visibility_only` or `identical`. `SurveysService.resolveSameVersionUpsert` throws 409 `sync_version_conflict` ("Same sync_version with different content") on conflict. On `visibility_only` it calls the same `applyVisibilityChange` write that `visibility_update` uses, which updates visibility and `updated_at` and inserts a `visibility_changed` event, and it answers `synced`, as D-16 amended requires. It is called at all three same-version points of `upsertForUser`: the direct equality check, the submitted-branch re-read and the draft-branch re-read after a lost `sync_version <` guard. The concurrent-create race also enters the direct check through `existing = raced`. Deleted-survey case: `getSurveyForUser(..., activeOnly=false)` returns soft-deleted rows. A visibility-only replay on one writes nothing and is answered `synced` (`!row.deleted_at` guard). A read-only difference on one is still 409. The feed now has no event-less survey query. When no event is found it returns empty arrays and keeps the cursor. Grep finds no remaining fallback. E2E `surveys-same-version.e2e-spec.ts` covers cases (1)–(7), including (3b) the installed-app `/sync` retry with rewritten visibility, (3c) visibility plus `site_name` giving 409 with neither applied, and (3d) the soft-deleted replay. `surveys-transactions.e2e-spec.ts` asserts one `synced` and one 409 for concurrent same-version upserts. All pass. |
| 3 | One `StorageService` owns the S3 client, bucket and local mode for surveys, attachments and users; profile pictures are in object storage and survive a container restart | ✓ VERIFIED | `grep "new S3Client" api/src` has one hit, `storage/storage.service.ts:59`. `@aws-sdk` is imported only in that file. There is no `fs/promises`, `ATTACHMENTS_UPLOAD_DIR` or `OBJECT_STORAGE_*` read outside it. `StorageModule` (non-global, one provider) is imported by `SurveysModule` and `UsersModule`. Nest deduplicates the module, so one instance and one client exist. The default bucket is now `ibp-media` everywhere. `SurveysService` uses it for object cleanup on deletion (`surveys.service.ts:1100`). `SurveysAttachmentsService` uses it for keys, presign, head, put, get and delete. `UsersService` uses `buildProfilePictureKey` → `putObject`, serves the bytes through `getObject` on `GET /me/profile-picture` (no redirect, D-15), deletes the previous object only after the row points at the new one, and reads a missing object as `profile_picture_url: null` on `/me`. A 404 on the picture route clears the stale columns. Surviving a restart: in MinIO mode (production) the object lives in the bucket, not on the container disk. The CI `itMinio` case "stores the picture in the bucket, not on local disk" passed on run 36157669303. The owner-check replay stopped and restarted the built API against MinIO and still got the picture and its bytes (VALIDATION.md, 20/20). |
| 4 | Storage keys are built only from validated identifiers and stay inside the upload directory in local mode; the presigned PUT enforces `ContentLength`; confirmation rejects a size mismatch with 422 | ✓ VERIFIED | `SAFE_ID_PATTERN = /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}$/`. I scanned the mobile git history: ids were generated only as `survey-${Date.now()}` and `randomUUID()`, and users get `gen_random_uuid()`, so no production id is rejected. Boundary: `SafeIdPipe` is on all 16 `:id`/`:attachmentId` params in `surveys.controller.ts`. The only unpiped params are `parcelId` and the report `id`, and neither reaches a storage key. `@Matches(SAFE_ID_PATTERN)` is on `SurveyUpsertDto.id`, the sync envelope `survey_id`, `SurveyDeletePayloadDto.id` and `AttachmentDeletePayloadDto.attachment_id`. The key builders check the ids again themselves (`assertSafeId`). In local mode every keyed call runs `resolveLocalPath`, which rejects anything outside `root + sep`, plus absolute keys and NUL bytes. `presignPut` sets `ContentLength` on the `PutObjectCommand`, so `content-length` is signed. `createAttachment` passes `size_bytes`. On confirm in MinIO mode, `headObject` is compared with `size_bytes`, and a mismatch deletes the object and throws 422 `attachment_size_mismatch`. In local mode the buffer length is compared before any write. E2E: `safe-ids.e2e-spec.ts` (legacy formats accepted, unsafe params 400, only the unsafe `/sync` ops fail) and `attachments-upload-size.e2e-spec.ts`. The local 422 passes here. The MinIO 403 on an oversized presigned PUT and the 422 plus delete at confirm pass on CI run 36157669303. Mobile declares `size_bytes` from the prepared file it uploads (`storage/attachments.ts` `getLocalFileSize(dest)`), so the signed length matches real uploads. |
| 5 | `isAllowedMimeType` uses an own-property check; `"constructor"` and other prototype keys are rejected | ✓ VERIFIED | `common/file.utils.ts`: `isAllowedMimeType` and `extensionFromMime` both use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES, …)`, per D-16 (ES2021 target, so no `Object.hasOwn`). The key builder answers 400, never 500, for types outside the allow-list. `file.utils.spec.ts` covers `constructor`, `__proto__`, etc.; `auth-profile.e2e-spec.ts` "rejects unsupported picture types with 400" passes. |
| 6 | `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` and `api-contract-v1.md` describe the new cursor and same-version rule | ✓ VERIFIED | `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` covers Case B with B1, B2 (visibility-only applied last-writer-wins, soft-deleted row gives `synced` with no write) and B3 (409). It also has a "Changes Feed Ordering" section: migration 014 columns, the snapshot rule, the cluster-wide delay, the `v2:<xid8>:<seq>` opaque cursor, legacy translation, the out-of-range 400, the future-cursor guard, and the xid8 procedure after a restore. `infra/vps/README.md` gives the same restore command. `api-contract-v1.md` describes the same-version rule for `POST /surveys` and `/sync`, the cursor format, the snapshot rule and legacy acceptance of `GET /sync/changes`, the signed Content-Length (403 from the store), the 422 `attachment_size_mismatch`, and the profile-picture routes. One small inaccuracy is recorded under Anti-Patterns. |

No orphaned requirements: REQUIREMENTS.md maps only these two IDs to Phase 1.6.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `api/src/surveys/surveys-normalize.utils.ts` | 465-475 | Some malformed legacy cursors pass the parser but make Postgres fail with a 500. The legacy check is a `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}[ T]` prefix plus `Date.parse`, which V8 accepts for strings such as `2024-02-30T00:00:00Z\|x` and `2024-01-01 12:00:00 junk\|x`. I confirmed the parser returns `kind: "legacy"` for both. Postgres then rejects the `$2::timestamptz` cast with 22008/22007, and no exception filter maps it, so the answer is a 500 instead of 400. | ⚠️ Warning | Not a regression: the pre-phase parser had the same `Date.parse` gate and cast. The phase narrowed the hole but did not close it. Cursors the server issued are always valid, since they came from `created_at::text`, so installed apps are unaffected. Only a hand-crafted request by an authenticated user hits it. `sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md:84` and `api-contract-v1.md:770` say "A malformed cursor … gets 400 Invalid sync cursor", which is not true for this subset. Suggested fix: map SQLSTATE 22007/22008 from the legacy translation query to 400, or validate the timestamp by round-tripping it. This fits Phase 01.7 or a small follow-up. |
| `.planning/phases/01.6-…/07-VALIDATION.md` | end | `**Approval:** pending`, while the frontmatter says `status: complete` | ℹ️ Info | Bookkeeping only |

A grep for `TBD|FIXME|XXX|TODO|HACK|PLACEHOLDER|not yet implemented|coming soon` across the 23 phase-changed files under `api/src`, `api/migrations`, `.github` and `docs` found nothing. I found no stub returns on response paths.

### Human Verification Required

None outstanding. The manual-only item was two devices, a photo upload with the signed Content-Length, and a picture that survives a restart. The owner waived the device steps, and the check was replayed against the built API at the merged commit 1a487d2 with real MinIO (same pinned image as CI) and a fresh database. The result was 20/20 checks, recorded in `07-VALIDATION.md` with main CI run 36159558295 green. What this replay does not exercise is the phone UI. The phase changes no mobile code, the cursor is opaque to the client, and the mobile unit suite (757/757) covers the client side. I read the mobile code: it declares `size_bytes` from the prepared file it uploads, so real uploads match the signed Content-Length. I accept this as recorded human evidence under the escalation gate contract.

### Gaps Summary

No blocking gaps. All six roadmap success criteria were checked against the source, not the SUMMARYs:

- the snapshot-filtered `(xid8, seq)` feed, with legacy translation, the future guard and the out-of-range 400
- removal of the fallback
- the same-version rule at all three upsert sites, including the visibility-only and soft-deleted cases
- a single S3 client in `StorageService`, used by surveys, attachments and users
- safe ids at the route and DTO boundary and again in the key builders, plus local path containment
- the signed ContentLength, and the 422 plus delete on a size mismatch
- the own-property MIME check
- profile pictures in object storage, served as bytes
- the MinIO E2E job gated by CI OK
- the docs

The unit suite (334) and the full local-mode E2E suite (116 passed, 3 MinIO-only skipped) pass here, and the MinIO-only cases pass on CI.

One non-blocking warning remains: a crafted legacy cursor with an out-of-range or trailing-junk timestamp still gets a 500 instead of the 400 the docs promise. This predates the phase, does not affect installed apps, and is a small follow-up.
