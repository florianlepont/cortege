# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Preview-state decision (image/loading/missing/unavailable) lives in one pure, unit-tested helper (resolveAttachmentPreview); screens only call it and render, since screens themselves are not exercised in Jest"
    - "A shared AttachmentPhotoPreview component (SurveyDetailScreen) renders the same expo-image/placeholder logic at all three photo sites (carousel, hero switch-thumb, debug), keyed by resolveAttachmentPreview's output"
    - "devOnlyHandler(handler, isDev) returns undefined outside dev builds; used at the one call site (AuthenticatedAppNavigation) that would otherwise inline an untested shouldShowDevTools() ternary in a 0%-coverage file"

key-decisions:
  - "Added devOnlyHandler() to dev-tools.ts instead of inlining shouldShowDevTools() ? x : undefined in AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx: the file has 0% coverage, so a new ternary there dropped ./src/app/ branch coverage below its 55% floor. Moving the branch into a tested helper keeps the ratchet from regressing (Rule 3 - blocking, coverage gate)."
  - "photoAttachments filter switched from Boolean(local_uri?.trim()) to isPhotoAttachment(mime type), so remote and missing rows stay in photoSlides/photoAttachments and get a loading/missing placeholder instead of disappearing (D-10, D-11, the plan's core requirement)"
  - "SurveyListScreen picks the first isPhotoAttachment per survey (not the first with a non-empty local_uri), so a survey whose only photo is still remote/missing shows a thumbnail placeholder in the list too, matching the detail screen's behavior"
  - "AttachmentPhotoPreview and the list's inline preview branch reuse the existing style objects (detailHeroPhotoImage, detailHeroSwitchThumbImage, debugAttachmentPreview/Placeholder, surveyCardPreview) with an inline centering style for placeholder content, rather than adding new keys to the .styles.ts files (which the plan's files_modified list does not include)"

patterns-established:
  - "Every future photo render site in this codebase should go through resolveAttachmentPreview + expo-image rather than reading local_uri directly"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 09: Mobile attachment display Summary

**Survey list thumbnails, the detail carousel/hero and the debug previews now render every owned photo through expo-image from a single tested preview-state helper, so a pulled ("remote") photo shows a loading spinner and triggers its download, and a missing local file shows a French message instead of silently vanishing.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~35 min
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 7 (0 created, 7 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `resolveAttachmentPreview` is the one function that decides whether an attachment renders as an image, a loading spinner, a missing-file message, or an unavailable-photo message, purely from `file_state`/`local_uri`; `selectPreviewCandidates` filters a `LocalAttachment[]` down to the `remote`/`local` photo rows a screen should ask `handleEnsureAttachmentPreviews` to fetch. Both are exhaustively unit-tested (`survey-screen-helpers.test.ts`), including the old-container-URI rebasing case via `resolveAttachmentUri`.
- `SurveyDetailScreen`'s carousel, hero switch-thumb and debug tab all render through one shared `AttachmentPhotoPreview` component: `expo-image` with `contentFit="cover"`, `cachePolicy="memory"`, `recyclingKey={attachment.id}` for the image case, and a placeholder (spinner for loading, an icon + French message for missing/unavailable) otherwise. The screen's `photoAttachments` filter now keys off MIME type (`isPhotoAttachment`) instead of a non-empty `local_uri`, so remote and missing photos stay in the carousel and keep the existing delete action reachable. A `useEffect` keyed on attachment ids + `file_state`s calls `onEnsureAttachmentPreviews` on open and whenever the attachment list changes. The debug tab gained a "Simuler un fichier manquant" button per attachment, rendered only when `shouldShowDevTools()` is true and the prop is provided.
- `SurveyListScreen`'s thumbnail now picks the first `isPhotoAttachment` (not the first with a non-empty URI) and renders the same four states — image via `expo-image`, a neutral spinner for loading, a warning icon for missing, a static image-off icon for unavailable (never a spinner for the last one). A `useEffect` over `visibleSurveys` requests previews for each survey's first photo.
- `AuthenticatedAppNavigation` wires `surveySync.handleEnsureAttachmentPreviews` into both screens and `surveySync.handleSimulateMissingAttachmentFile` into the detail screen, gated to dev builds through the new `devOnlyHandler()` helper.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (TDD for Task 1: RED then GREEN):

1. **Task 1: Pure preview-state helper with tests** - `56a74e3` (test, RED) then `aa6d9b8` (feat, GREEN)
2. **Task 2: Screens render through expo-image with loading/missing states; navigation wiring** - `4497365` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `mobile/src/screens/survey-screen-helpers.ts` - `resolveAttachmentPreview`, `isPhotoAttachment`, `selectPreviewCandidates`, `AttachmentPreview` type, the three French message constants
- `mobile/src/screens/survey-screen-helpers.test.ts` - 11 new tests covering all documented behaviors
- `mobile/src/screens/SurveyDetailScreen.tsx` - `AttachmentPhotoPreview` shared render helper; `photoAttachments` filter switched to `isPhotoAttachment`; ensure-previews effect; dev-only simulate-missing button; two new optional props
- `mobile/src/screens/SurveyListScreen.tsx` - thumbnail picks first photo attachment and renders all four preview states; ensure-previews effect over visible surveys; one new optional prop
- `mobile/src/app/AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx` - passes `onEnsureAttachmentPreviews` to both screens and `onSimulateMissingAttachmentFile` (via `devOnlyHandler`) to the detail screen
- `mobile/src/app/dev-tools.ts` - new `devOnlyHandler<T>(handler, isDev)` helper
- `mobile/src/app/dev-tools.test.ts` - 2 new tests for `devOnlyHandler`

## Decisions Made

- Kept all photo-preview logic in `survey-screen-helpers.ts` and one shared `AttachmentPhotoPreview` component rather than duplicating the state switch at each of the three detail-screen render sites, since screens are unrendered in Jest and any inline logic there would be untestable.
- Chose `devOnlyHandler()` over inlining the dev-gate ternary directly in `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx` specifically because the coverage-threshold run (`npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage`) failed on `./src/app/` branches (54.97% < 55% floor) with the inline ternary; moving the branch into a small, tested pure function in `dev-tools.ts` (already 100%-covered) restored the floor without touching untested navigation code.
- Reused existing `.styles.ts` style keys (`detailHeroPhotoImage`, `detailHeroSwitchThumbImage`, `debugAttachmentPreview`/`debugAttachmentPreviewPlaceholder`, `surveyCardPreview`) for both the image and placeholder cases, adding only inline centering styles for placeholder content, since the plan's `files_modified` list does not include either `.styles.ts` file.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Moved the dev-only handler gate into a tested helper to keep coverage floor**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (navigation wiring, after running the plan's `test:unit:coverage` verification command)
- **Issue:** Inlining `shouldShowDevTools() ? surveySync.handleSimulateMissingAttachmentFile : undefined` directly in `AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx` (a file at 0% coverage, never rendered in Jest) added an uncovered branch and dropped `./src/app/` branch coverage from ≥55% to 54.97%, failing the ratchet threshold in `jest.unit.config.js`.
- **Fix:** Added `devOnlyHandler<T>(handler, isDev = __DEV__): T | undefined` to `dev-tools.ts` (already 100%-covered) with two new unit tests, and call it from the navigation file instead of inlining the ternary there.
- **Files modified:** mobile/src/app/dev-tools.ts, mobile/src/app/dev-tools.test.ts, mobile/src/app/AuthenticatedAppNavigation.tsx
- **Verification:** `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` passes with no threshold failures (656 → 658 tests, all directory floors held)
- **Committed in:** 4497365 (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (blocking coverage-gate fix)
**Impact on plan:** No change to the plan's public API or behavior (`onSimulateMissingAttachmentFile` is still `undefined` outside dev builds, per T-01.5-32); purely an internal refactor to satisfy the existing coverage ratchet.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the deviation above.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 11 (attachment integrity and purge) and plan 12 (device check) can rely on the debug tab's "Simuler un fichier manquant" button and the underlying `handleSimulateMissingAttachmentFile` wiring exactly as exposed here.
- Every photo render site in `SurveyDetailScreen.tsx` and `SurveyListScreen.tsx` now goes through `resolveAttachmentPreview`; any future screen that renders an attachment should follow the same pattern rather than reading `local_uri` directly.
- No blockers for the rest of the phase. Coverage thresholds, lint, typecheck, format:check and `expo export --platform android` are all green in this worktree.
