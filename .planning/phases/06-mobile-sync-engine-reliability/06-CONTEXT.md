# Phase 01.5: Mobile sync engine reliability - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-09-25
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Owner decisions taken during `/gsd:plan-phase 1.5` after research (no discuss-phase run), plus the audit decisions in `.planning/PROJECT.md` → Key Decisions

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Audit lots L11a, L11b and L12 (`docs/audits/plan-remediation-2026-09.md`). On the phone, the sync queue drains exactly once, in batches of at most 100, and survives crashes. The documented retry cap works, and every request has a timeout. A pull never overwrites a pending or blocked local change. Multi-statement SQLite writes are transactional, the schema is versioned, and new IDs are UUIDs. Photos are resized, stored durably and streamed on upload, and are never deleted silently. Server photos are displayable, and the app starts offline with valid stored credentials. The phone's existing local data (surveys, queue, photos) must survive the upgrade.

## Implementation Decisions

### Scope and delivery
- D-01: **Server-photo display is in this phase** (owner decision). One small additive API endpoint returns a short-lived presigned download URL for an attachment the caller may read, reusing the existing presigner in `surveys-attachments.service.ts`, with an E2E test. This is the only `api/` change; the storage unification stays in phase 01.6.
- D-02: **Single delivery** (owner decision). The four new native modules (`expo-image`, `expo-image-manipulator`, `expo-file-system`, `expo-crypto`, SDK 57 versions installed with `npx expo install`) land in the same phase. The phase gate needs one device check on a fresh dev build after `npx expo prebuild --clean`: sync, offline cold start, photo capture/resize/upload, server-photo display. Native config goes through `app.json`/plugins only (CNG).

### Sync engine (REQ-AUD-sync-engine)
- D-03: A module-level single flight guards drain and pull. Every path that syncs, including `handleDeleteAttachment` and `updateSurveyVisibility`, goes through it. Two concurrent triggers produce one `POST /sync`.
- D-04: The queue drains in batches of at most 100. A survey becomes `synced` only when no other queue row exists for it.
- D-05: The retry classification is explicit (`fatal` / `retryable` / unknown) and replaces the nullable `terminalOverride ?? …` logic. Network errors, timeouts, 5xx and 429 never consume the cap. After 8 counted failures a row is `sync_blocked`. The server's fatal codes (including the 01.4 codes) block immediately without a retry loop.
- D-06: **Existing queue rows get their `retry_count` reset to 0 by the migration** (owner decision), so rows inflated by the old bug get a fresh 8 attempts.
- D-07: Every sync request goes through the HTTP client with a timeout. A pull never overwrites a survey that has a pending, failed or blocked local change; the guard must also cover `sync_blocked` surveys, which have no queue row left.

### Local storage (REQ-AUD-local-storage)
- D-08: The schema is versioned with `PRAGMA user_version`, and the migrations are idempotent. Existing installs (version 0 with the current tables) migrate without data loss. Multi-statement writes run in a transaction. New IDs are UUIDs (`expo-crypto` `randomUUID`), and existing IDs are kept.

### Photos (REQ-AUD-photos)
- D-09: At capture, a photo is resized to at most 2048 px on its long edge and saved as JPEG at quality 0.7. It is then copied to the document directory, not the cache. Upload streams from the file instead of loading a blob into memory. The real file size replaces the fake 500 000.
- D-10: A local file that has gone missing is shown to the user (the attachment is marked unavailable, with a message), never deleted silently.
- D-11: Attachments pulled from the server are fetched on demand through the D-01 presigned URL and cached locally, which ends the `local_uri=""` dead rows. Thumbnails and the detail carousel render through `expo-image` from downsized sources.
- D-12: Use `expo-file-system/legacy` (`uploadAsync`, `documentDirectory`) in this phase. The `File`/`Directory` API migration is deferred. The planner verifies the exact SDK 57 API of `expo-image-manipulator` from the official docs before writing task code.

### Offline start (REQ-AUD-offline-start)
- D-13: The last successful `/me` profile is cached locally. On a cold start with valid stored credentials but no network, the cached profile is used, so the signed-in screens open instead of the login overlay. The profile refreshes from `/me` once the API is reachable. An explicit `invalid_grant` still ends the session (phase 01.2 rule unchanged).

### Refinements after pattern mapping (Claude, within D-01..D-13)
- D-14 (resolves PATTERNS C1): the failures that count toward the 8-attempt cap are only the ambiguous ones:
  - a client-side exception that is neither a network error nor a timeout (for example an unreadable local file or an unparsable response);
  - a server per-operation `retryable_error` with no 5xx/429 status.
  Network errors, timeouts, 5xx and 429 retry with backoff and are never counted. Fatal results block at once. Tests must cover each class.
- D-15 (resolves C6/C7): uploads use `expo-file-system/legacy` `createUploadTask`, cancelled after a timeout of 120 s (a constant). Local-mode API uploads use `MULTIPART` with `fieldName: "file"`; presigned uploads use `BINARY_CONTENT`. All JSON requests go through `apiRequest` in `client.ts`, with its timeout.
- D-16 (C8): resize only the longer axis, and only when it exceeds 2048 px; never upscale. Use the SDK 57 `manipulate().resize().renderAsync().saveAsync()` API.
- D-17 (C9, C14):
  - `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` runs outside any transaction.
  - Transactions are never nested. One helper owns `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, and callers pass the transaction handle.
  - A module-level mutex serialises the transactional writers, because `withTransactionAsync` is not exclusive.
- D-18 (C10): in local storage mode, the D-01 download endpoint serves the file through the `StreamableFile` pattern (`users.controller.ts:71-80`). In MinIO/S3 mode it returns a presigned GET URL. The response shape is the same in both modes, and ownership and visibility checks are enforced.
- Note (C11–C13): CLAUDE.md is outdated (Expo 57 / RN 0.86.3, mocks in `mobile/test/`, key/value table `local_meta`). The fix is left to phase 01.9 hygiene; plans follow the code.

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact module layout (e.g. a new `mobile/src/storage/attachments.ts`), the plan split and waves (plans touching `sync.ts` / `useSurveySync*.ts` / `db.ts` must be sequenced), and the test mocks. Coverage thresholds in `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` may only go up.

## Deferred Ideas

- Migration to the `expo-file-system` `File`/`Directory` API: later.
- Unified storage service and a bounded `/sync/changes` feed: phase 01.6.
