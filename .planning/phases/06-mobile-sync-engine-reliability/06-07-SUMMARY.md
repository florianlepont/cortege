provides:
  - "attachments.ts: computeResizeTarget, preparePhotoForStorage, uploadAttachmentFile, persistLegacyAttachmentFiles, LocalFileMissingError, UploadTimeoutError"
  - "queueAttachmentAsset (useSurveySyncSurveyOperations) resizes/re-encodes/persists every captured photo before queueing, with the real file size"

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "ImageManipulator.manipulate(uri).resize(target?).renderAsync().saveAsync({ format: JPEG, compress: 0.7 }) — resize only when computeResizeTarget returns non-null, never re-render twice unless dimensions were unknown"
    - "createUploadTask + Promise.race against a UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS timer that calls cancelAsync() on timeout, instead of the legacy uploadAsync (no timeout support)"
    - "Best-effort startup migration: persistLegacyAttachmentFiles() awaited but .catch(() => undefined)'d in App.tsx so a rescue failure never blocks app start"

key-decisions:
  - "uploadAttachmentFile's FileSystemUploadOptions built as a single typed variable (cast via the exported FileSystemUploadOptions union) rather than two separate createUploadTask call sites, both to satisfy tsc (a naive ternary of two inline object literals doesn't narrow to the discriminated union) and to keep exactly one createUploadTask call site as the plan's acceptance grep expects"
  - "persistLegacyAttachmentFiles finds the matching attachment_upload queue row via a payload LIKE '%id%' pre-filter then a real isAttachmentQueuePayload + local_attachment_id equality check, mirroring the existing deleteQueuedSurveyUpserts pattern in utils.ts rather than adding a new indexed lookup"
  - "queueAttachmentAsset's cleanup-on-queue-failure wraps only the queueLocalAttachment call: preparePhotoForStorage failures do not delete anything (nothing was persisted yet) and are reported through the existing outer catch as 'Attachment queue error: ...'"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 07: Photo capture pipeline (resize, persist, stream upload) Summary

**Every captured photo is resized on its longer axis only (max 2048px, never upscaled), re-encoded to JPEG 0.7, and copied into documentDirectory/attachments/ with its real byte size before it's queued; a tested `uploadAttachmentFile` streams from disk via `createUploadTask` with a 120s cancellation, and `persistLegacyAttachmentFiles` rescues older-app-version photos out of the OS-purgeable cache on every start.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~50 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 6 (3 created, 3 modified)

## Accomplishments
- `computeResizeTarget` (pure) and `preparePhotoForStorage` implement D-09/D-16/C8 exactly: resize target is computed from the longer axis only, a photo already under the 2048px cap is never resized (and never upscaled), and every photo — resized or not — is always re-encoded to JPEG at quality 0.7 (this is also what silently converts HEIC captures to JPEG) and copied into `documentDirectory/attachments/<uuid>.jpg` before `queueLocalAttachment` ever sees it. The manipulator's own temp file is deleted afterward (best-effort).
- `uploadAttachmentFile` gives plan 11 a tested streaming primitive (D-15): `createUploadTask` with `MULTIPART` + `fieldName: "file"` + a bearer token for the API's `/upload?token=` route, or `BINARY_CONTENT` + `Content-Type` (no Authorization header) for a presigned URL; it throws `LocalFileMissingError` when the file is gone and `UploadTimeoutError` after `UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS` (120s) or when `uploadAsync()` resolves `null`/`undefined` (a cancelled task).
- `persistLegacyAttachmentFiles` closes the T-01.5-26 gap: on every app start it finds `local_attachments` rows still pointing at the OS-purgeable ImagePicker cache, copies any file that still exists into the attachments dir and repoints both the row's `local_uri` and any matching `attachment_upload` queue payload in one `runInTransaction`; a synced attachment whose cache file is already gone becomes `file_state: 'remote'` (re-fetched later); a still-pending one whose file is gone is left alone for plan 11 to report as unavailable.
- `queueAttachmentAsset` (camera + library) now calls `preparePhotoForStorage` before queueing, deletes the persisted file if `queueLocalAttachment` then fails (no orphaned file), and never falls back to a fake `500_000` byte size.
- `App.tsx`'s bootstrap effect runs `persistLegacyAttachmentFiles()` right after `initLocalDb()`, `.catch(() => undefined)`'d so a rescue failure can never block app start.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: attachments.ts capture, upload and legacy-file primitives with tests** - `49539e8` (feat, tests included alongside per TDD)
2. **Task 2: Capture flow uses the pipeline; legacy files persisted at startup** - `7ae2733` (feat)

_Both tasks were `tdd="true"`; test files were authored together with the implementation in each commit._

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/storage/attachments.ts` - `MAX_PHOTO_EDGE_PX`, `PHOTO_JPEG_QUALITY`, `UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`, `computeResizeTarget`, `preparePhotoForStorage`, `uploadAttachmentFile`, `persistLegacyAttachmentFiles`, `LocalFileMissingError`, `UploadTimeoutError`
- `mobile/src/storage/attachments.test.ts` - 20 mocked-module tests (resize math, re-encode/persist, timeout/missing-file upload paths, fake timers)
- `mobile/src/storage/attachments.sqlite.test.ts` - 5 real-SQL tests for `persistLegacyAttachmentFiles` (move+repoint, mark-remote, leave-untouched, already-in-dir, idempotent re-run)
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts` - `queueAttachmentAsset` calls `preparePhotoForStorage`, deletes the persisted file on a subsequent queue failure, drops the `500_000` fallback
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts` - mocks `../../storage/attachments` and `../../storage/attachment-files`; updated/added camera+library success tests and two new failure-path tests
- `mobile/App.tsx` - bootstrap effect calls `persistLegacyAttachmentFiles()` (best-effort) after `initLocalDb()`

## Decisions Made
- Built `uploadAttachmentFile`'s options as one `FileSystemUploadOptions`-typed variable feeding a single `createUploadTask` call, rather than two separate call sites per branch — `tsc` rejects a two-branch ternary of inline ad-hoc object literals against the `UploadOptionsBinary | UploadOptionsMultipart` discriminated union (the `headers` shapes don't unify), and the plan's acceptance grep (`createUploadTask` count 1) rules out the duplicated-call-site alternative anyway.
- `persistLegacyAttachmentFiles` rewrites queue payloads using the same `SELECT ... LIKE '%id%'` pre-filter + real JSON-guard-check pattern already used by `deleteQueuedSurveyUpserts` in `utils.ts`, instead of introducing a new indexed queue lookup — consistent with the existing codebase pattern and sufficient at mobile scale (a handful of queued attachment uploads per device).

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed as written. One minor implementation choice (single-call-site typed options object for `uploadAttachmentFile`) was needed to satisfy both `tsc` and the acceptance-criteria grep; documented above under Decisions Made rather than as a deviation since it doesn't change any documented behavior.

## Issues Encountered
- Initial TypeScript compile error: a ternary producing two inline `createUploadTask` call sites failed to unify against the SDK's `FileSystemUploadOptions` discriminated union (`headers` property type mismatch between the binary and multipart option shapes). Fixed by building a single explicitly-typed `options: FileSystemUploadOptions` variable and calling `createUploadTask` once — see Decisions Made.
- `npx prettier --write` was required on `attachments.ts` and `attachments.sqlite.test.ts` after the initial TDD pass; re-ran the full test/lint/typecheck suite afterward to confirm no regressions.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 11 (sync engine attachment upload/download integration) can now import `uploadAttachmentFile`, `LocalFileMissingError` and `UploadTimeoutError` from `mobile/src/storage/attachments` to classify upload outcomes, replacing `sync.ts`'s current `fetch`-based `uploadFileViaApi`/`uploadFileDirect` helpers.
- `sync.ts` itself was not touched by this plan (out of scope, owned by plan 11); its upload helpers still use `fetch`/blob loading and will be replaced when plan 11 wires in `uploadAttachmentFile`.
- Full mobile suite: 48 test suites / 600 tests pass; coverage thresholds hold (`test:unit:coverage` exits 0); `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check` all clean at the repo root.
