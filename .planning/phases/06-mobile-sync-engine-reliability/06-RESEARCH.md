# Phase 01.5: Mobile sync engine reliability - Research

**Researched:** 2026-09-25
**Domain:** React Native / Expo offline-first sync engine (SQLite queue, HTTP batch sync, photo capture/upload, cold-start auth)
**Confidence:** HIGH (code-verified) for current-state findings; MEDIUM for new-package version pins; LOW/ASSUMED flagged inline for anything not confirmed on-device

## Summary

This phase closes audit lots L11a, L11b, L12 plus the offline-cold-start finding. All of the audited
defects were re-verified directly against the current code on 2026-09-25 (not from the audit text
alone) and **all seven still reproduce** — none were incidentally fixed by Phase 01.4 (which touched
only `api/`). The mobile side has one single-flight gap, one inoperative retry cap (a `??`/`false`
footgun, not a missing check), zero batching, zero SQLite transactions/versioning, full-resolution
photos loaded entirely into JS memory for upload, dead remote-attachment rows, and a cold-start bug
where a valid Auth0 session is hidden behind the login screen whenever `/me` is unreachable.

None of `expo-image`, `expo-image-manipulator`, `expo-file-system`, or `expo-crypto` are installed.
All four are official first-party Expo SDK packages (`slopcheck`: `[OK]` on all four; not
slopsquat risk), and versions matching the installed Expo SDK (`~57.0.24`) exist on the npm
registry. Adding them requires a `Info.plist`/`AndroidManifest` regeneration (`expo prebuild`) and
therefore **a new dev-client build on every test device** before any of L12's photo work can be
exercised past unit tests — flag this early since `ios/`/`android/` are not committed (CNG model).

Phase 01.5's touch surface is almost entirely `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts`,
`mobile/src/storage/db.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useEditingDraft.ts`, and the
`useSurveySync*` hook family — the same hotspot files the roadmap already calls out. One roadmap
success criterion (attachment display via presigned URL) cannot be delivered as literally worded
without a small, additive `api/` endpoint, because no such endpoint exists yet (see Open Question 1).

**Primary recommendation:** Sequence the phase as SQLite foundation (transactions + `PRAGMA
user_version` + indexes) first, since every other wave writes through it; then sync-engine
concurrency/batching/retry-cap; then photos; then cold-start caching last (independent, low risk,
can run in parallel with photos). Gate every native-module-consuming task behind a
`checkpoint:human-verify` for a dev-client rebuild.

## Phase Requirements

| ID | Description | Research Support |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| REQ-AUD-sync-engine | Queue drains single-flight, batches of at most 100, marks synced only when queue empty, honours retry cap without counting network/5xx, times out every request, never lets a pull overwrite pending/blocked local changes, autosave reschedules instead of skipping, new IDs are UUIDs | Patterns 1-3, 5; Common Pitfalls 3, 5; Code Example "Timeout-safe fetch"; Don't Hand-Roll (UUIDs) |
| REQ-AUD-local-storage | Multi-statement SQLite writes transactional, schema versioned with `PRAGMA user_version`, queue rows carry explicit `op_type`, queue is indexed | Pattern 4; Common Pitfall 4 |
| REQ-AUD-photos | Photos resized and persisted to document directory at capture, uploaded by streaming, network errors don't consume retry cap, missing local file surfaced not silently dropped; remote attachments displayable; thumbnails via `expo-image` | Standard Stack (expo-image-manipulator, expo-file-system, expo-image); Code Examples "Streaming attachment upload", "Resize + persist"; Open Question 1 (download endpoint gap) |
| REQ-AUD-offline-start | Cold start with no network + valid stored credentials opens signed-in app with last known cached profile instead of login overlay; profile refreshes from `/me` when reachable | Summary; Security Domain (V8, cached-profile threat pattern); Validation Architecture test row |
</phase_requirements>

## Architectural Responsibility Map

| Capability | Primary Tier | Secondary Tier | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Sync queue single-flight / batching / retry cap | Mobile (client) | — | Pure client-side orchestration against an already-correct server contract (Phase 01.4) |
| SQLite schema versioning & transactions | Mobile (client, local storage) | — | `expo-sqlite` is local-only; no server involvement |
| Photo resize/persist/upload | Mobile (client) | API (unavoidable, minimal) | Resize/persist is 100% client; upload target/streaming already fits the existing `POST .../attachments` + presigned/API PUT contract, no API change needed for upload |
| Remote attachment display (presigned URL) | API (must expose a download URL) | Mobile (client fetch+cache) | The API currently has no attachment download/presign-GET endpoint at all — see Open Question 1 |
| Cold-start auth state / cached profile | Mobile (client) | — | `useAuth0Session` + local cache; server `/me` is a refresh path, not a gate |

## Standard Stack

### Core
| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `expo-crypto` | `~57.0.3` | `Crypto.randomUUID()` for new local survey/attachment IDs | Official Expo module; replaces `survey-${Date.now()}` / `attachment-${Date.now()}-${rand(1000)}` (audit: "IDs non uniques") [VERIFIED: npm registry, official Expo SDK package] |
| `expo-image-manipulator` | `~57.0.20` | Resize captured photos to 2048px long edge, JPEG quality 0.7, before persisting | Official Expo module, already the audit-recommended tool (lot L12) [VERIFIED: npm registry] |
| `expo-file-system` | `~57.0.7` | Copy captured photo into `documentDirectory/attachments/`, streaming upload (`File.upload` / legacy `uploadAsync`), file existence checks for "missing local file" detection | Official Expo module; only supported way to reach persistent, OS-non-purgeable storage on both platforms [VERIFIED: npm registry] |
| `expo-image` | `~57.0.5` | Thumbnails + detail carousel rendering from downsized sources, with disk/memory caching | Official Expo module; RN core `Image` (currently used everywhere — `SurveyDetailScreen.tsx:762,814,1222`, `SurveyListScreen.tsx:577,1063,1110`) has no built-in downsampling or cache-key control [VERIFIED: npm registry] |

### Supporting
| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| (none new) | — | Single-flight, batching, retry-cap, transactions are pure TypeScript/SQL against the already-installed `expo-sqlite` | No new dependency needed for L11a/L11b — this is a bug-fix/refactor of existing code |

### Alternatives Considered
| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `expo-file-system` legacy `uploadAsync` | New `File`/`Directory` class `file.upload(url, { uploadType })` (SDK 54+) | Legacy `uploadAsync` still ships under `expo-file-system/legacy` in SDK 57 and is simpler to test/mock; the new `File` API is the forward path but has more moving parts (task objects) for a marginal benefit here. **Recommendation: use the legacy namespace import (`import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system/legacy"`) for this phase** — it is explicitly still supported, avoids a second migration inside the same phase, and every code example below uses it. [CITED: docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy, docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem — confirmed via WebFetch 2026-09-25] |
| `expo-image-manipulator`'s legacy callback API | `ImageManipulator.manipulate(uri).resize(...).renderAsync()` context API | SDK 57 ships the newer context-based `manipulate()` API; the legacy `manipulateAsync` free function is deprecated but present. **Recommendation: use the new context API** since this is a fresh integration (no existing call site to preserve) — verify exact signature via Context7/official docs at plan time, this was not independently re-verified against SDK 57 release notes in this session [ASSUMED — confidence: MEDIUM, based on general Expo SDK 51+ manipulator API trend, not confirmed against the SDK 57 changelog specifically] |

**Installation:**
```bash
cd mobile
npm install expo-crypto@~57.0.3 expo-image-manipulator@~57.0.20 expo-file-system@~57.0.7 expo-image@~57.0.5
npx expo prebuild --clean   # regenerates ios/ and android/ — required after adding these plugins
```

**Version verification:** confirmed via `npm view <pkg> versions --json` against the installed `expo@~57.0.24` line (2026-09-25). Do not trust training-data version guesses — SDK 57 is newer than this agent's training cutoff assumptions; always re-run `npm view expo version` and match the SDK line before pinning in the plan.

## Package Legitimacy Audit

| Package | Registry | Age | Downloads | Source Repo | slopcheck | Disposition |
|---------|----------|-----|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `expo-crypto` | npm | Years (Expo SDK package, versioned in lockstep with `expo`) | High (bundled dependency of nearly every Expo app) | github.com/expo/expo | `[OK]` | Approved |
| `expo-file-system` | npm | Years | High | github.com/expo/expo | `[OK]` | Approved |
| `expo-image` | npm | Years | High | github.com/expo/expo | `[OK]` | Approved |
| `expo-image-manipulator` | npm | Years | High | github.com/expo/expo | `[OK]` | Approved |

**Packages removed due to slopcheck [SLOP] verdict:** none
**Packages flagged as suspicious [SUS]:** none

`slopcheck install <pkgs>` was run live against the npm registry on 2026-09-25 (all four `[OK]`).
Note for the planner: `slopcheck install` performs a real `npm install` as a side effect — the
researcher reverted `package.json`/`package-lock.json` with `git checkout` immediately after
capturing the result. The planner's actual install task must re-run `npm install` for real.

                    queue row OR sync_blocked=1 (store remote version aside,
                    flag conflict) — never silently overwrite
```

### Recommended Project Structure
No new top-level folders. Work stays inside existing files:
```
mobile/src/storage/
├── db.ts              # PRAGMA user_version migrations, indexes, WAL
├── sync.ts            # single-flight, batching, retry-cap fix, transaction-wrapped writes
├── surveys.ts          # withTransactionAsync around updateLocalDraft
├── utils.ts            # op_type helpers, classification helpers (already has isTerminalSurveyError etc.)
└── attachments.ts      # NEW (recommended) — capture/resize/persist/upload-stream helpers,
                         #   split out of the hooks so they're independently unit-testable
mobile/src/hooks/
├── useEditingDraft.ts                          # autosave reschedule + AppState flush
└── survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts # capture flow calls into storage/attachments.ts
```

### Pattern 1: Module-level single-flight
**What:** A shared `Promise` held at module scope in `sync.ts`; every entry point (`runSync`,
`handleDeleteAttachment`, `updateSurveyVisibility`, `handlePullChanges`) awaits the same promise
instead of calling `syncPending`/`pullRemoteChanges` directly.
**When to use:** Any function that can be triggered from more than one UI path concurrently.
**Example:**
```typescript
// mobile/src/storage/sync.ts — new pattern, no existing example in codebase
let inFlightSync: Promise<SyncResult> | null = null

export function requestSync(apiUrl: string, accessToken: string): Promise<SyncResult> {
  if (!inFlightSync) {
    inFlightSync = syncPending(apiUrl, accessToken).finally(() => {
      inFlightSync = null
    })
  }
  return inFlightSync
}
```
Confirmed gap: `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts:390`
(`handleDeleteAttachment` calls `syncPending` via `runOwnerGuardedSync`, not through any lock) and
`mobile/src/storage/sync.ts:1106` (`updateSurveyVisibility` calls `syncPending(apiUrl, accessToken)`
directly) both bypass whatever lock exists on `runSync`. `pullRemoteChanges` has no lock at all.

### Pattern 2: Batch chunking with per-batch time budget
**What:** Loop `queueRows` in chunks of at most 100, issuing one `POST /sync` per chunk, continuing
until the queue (that was snapshotted at loop start) is drained or a time budget is exceeded.
**When to use:** `syncPending`'s single `operations` array today has **no `LIMIT`** at all
(`sync.ts:649-656`) — confirmed the query pulls every `pending`/`failed` row unconditionally. The
server rejects batches over 100 (`api/src/surveys/surveys-sync.service.ts` batch bound, confirmed
D-02 in Phase 01.4 CONTEXT: "batch array bounds (1..100 operations) are validated at the
controller").
**Example:**
```typescript
const CHUNK_SIZE = 100
for (let i = 0; i < queueRows.length; i += CHUNK_SIZE) {
  const chunk = queueRows.slice(i, i + CHUNK_SIZE)
  // build operations[] from chunk, POST, process results — existing per-row logic reused
}
```

### Pattern 3: Fix the retry-cap `??`/`false` bug at its root
**What:** `handleSurveySyncFailure`/`handleAttachmentSyncFailure` compute
`terminal = options?.terminalOverride ?? (terminalByMessage || reachedRetryCap)`. Every call site
that explicitly passes `terminalOverride: false` (network/5xx catch block, `sync.ts:807/811/815`;
retryable-error branch, `sync.ts:887/893/899` via `terminalOverride: result.status === "fatal_error"`)
locks `terminal` to `false` forever for that error class, because `false ?? x` evaluates to `false`,
not `x`. **This means `reachedRetryCap` is silently ignored whenever a caller passes an explicit
`false`, which is every non-fatal path** — the documented "8 attempts then sync_blocked" cap never
fires for retryable/network errors today. [VERIFIED: read `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts` lines
421-423, 469-471, 511, 774, 807-899 directly, 2026-09-25]
**Fix:** stop using a nullable boolean with `??`. Replace with an explicit three-state classification:
```typescript
type FailureClassification = "fatal" | "retryable" | "unknown"
// unknown falls through to terminalByMessage || reachedRetryCap (today's intended default)
// fatal always terminal; retryable is NEVER terminal by classification alone but
// retry_count still increments and reachedRetryCap still applies on top of it
const terminal =
  options?.classification === "fatal"
    ? true
    : terminalByMessage || reachedRetryCap
```
This also fixes the audit's exact reproduction case: 8 consecutive 5xx/network failures on the same
survey must flip it to `sync_blocked`, and today they don't.

### Pattern 4: SQLite `PRAGMA user_version` migrations
**What:** Replace `addColumnIfMissing`'s swallow-everything `.catch(() => {})` pattern with numbered
migration functions gated by `PRAGMA user_version`, each running inside a transaction.
**Example:**
```typescript
// mobile/src/storage/db.ts
const MIGRATIONS: Array<(db: SQLite.SQLiteDatabase) => Promise<void>> = [
  async (db) => { /* v1 -> v2: add sync_queue.op_type, backfill from JSON shape */ },
  async (db) => { /* v2 -> v3: indexes + WAL */ },
]

export async function runMigrations(db: SQLite.SQLiteDatabase): Promise<void> {
  const { user_version: currentVersion } = (await db.getFirstAsync<{ user_version: number }>(
    "PRAGMA user_version",
  ))!
  for (let v = currentVersion; v < MIGRATIONS.length; v += 1) {
    await db.withTransactionAsync(async () => {
      await MIGRATIONS[v](db)
      await db.execAsync(`PRAGMA user_version = ${v + 1}`)
    })
  }
}
```
**Critical constraint:** existing installs are already at an un-versioned schema (today's
`initLocalDb` has no `user_version` calls at all — confirmed by reading `db.ts` end to end, only 131
lines, no `PRAGMA` anywhere). Migration 0 must be idempotent against *both* a fresh install and an
existing phone's DB that already has all the `addColumnIfMissing` columns from the old code path.
Never `DROP`/`CREATE` — always `ADD COLUMN` / `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` guarded by version, so a
field survey's local data is never at risk.

### Pattern 5: Never overwrite a survey with a pending OR blocked local change
**What:** `applyRemoteChanges` (confirmed `sync.ts:222-291`) already guards the "pending queue"
case correctly via `hasPendingQueueForSurvey` (checks `status IN ('pending','failed')`) — **but a
`sync_blocked` survey has no queue row left** (the row is deleted when a failure becomes terminal;
`handleSurveySyncFailure` does `DELETE FROM sync_queue WHERE id = ?` in the terminal branch). So a
survey that hit the retry cap and is `sync_blocked=1` currently has **no protection** — the next
pull will silently overwrite it. Extend the guard:
```typescript
const existing = await db.getFirstAsync<{ sync_blocked: number }>(
  "SELECT sync_blocked FROM local_surveys WHERE id = ?", [survey.id],
)
const protectedLocally = pendingQueue || Boolean(existing?.sync_blocked)
if (!protectedLocally) { /* apply remote update */ }
else { /* store remote version aside for conflict UI, per sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md */ }
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **`??` with an explicit `false` override:** as shown in Pattern 3, `??` only falls through on
  `null`/`undefined` — never encode a tri-state ("don't know" vs "definitely false") as a plain
  boolean consumed with `??`.
- **`fetch(uri).then(r => r.blob())` for local file upload:** loads the entire photo into JS memory
  (`uploadFileDirect`, `sync.ts:156-166`) — replace with `FileSystem.uploadAsync`/`File.upload`
  streaming from disk.
- **Swallowing every `ALTER TABLE` error identically:** `addColumnIfMissing`'s blanket
  `.catch(() => {})` (`db.ts:126-130`) hides real corruption the same way it hides
  "column already exists" — a versioned migration makes this distinction explicit.

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| Unique local IDs | Custom timestamp+random ID scheme | `Crypto.randomUUID()` (`expo-crypto`) | `survey-${Date.now()}` collides across two rapid inserts and is not globally unique against server-generated UUIDs; `expo-crypto` wraps the native CSPRNG correctly on both platforms |
| Image resize | Manual canvas/bitmap manipulation | `expo-image-manipulator` | Handles EXIF orientation, platform-native codecs, and memory-safe downscaling; hand-rolling risks memory spikes on large camera JPEGs (3-5MB source) |
| Streaming upload | Manual chunked `fetch` with a `ReadableStream` polyfill | `expo-file-system` `uploadAsync`/`File.upload` | React Native's `fetch` does not support streaming request bodies from a file path without a native bridge; the Expo module already does this correctly on both OSes |
| Thumbnail caching | Manual `AsyncStorage`/filesystem cache keyed by URI | `expo-image`'s built-in disk+memory cache | Cache invalidation, memory pressure eviction, and downsampling-to-render-size are already solved; a hand-rolled cache duplicates this with more bugs |

**Key insight:** every "don't hand-roll" item here is a first-party Expo module already scoped to
exactly this problem — there is no ecosystem choice to make, only an installation and integration
task.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Adding native modules without a dev-client rebuild
**What goes wrong:** `expo-crypto`, `expo-file-system`, `expo-image`, `expo-image-manipulator` all
ship native code. Since `ios/`/`android/` are generated by `expo prebuild` and are **not committed**
(per `CLAUDE.md`, confirmed: no `mobile/ios` or `mobile/android` directories tracked), adding these
packages changes the native dependency graph. Anyone running the existing dev client (or a device
build from before this phase) will crash or silently no-op on the new native calls until they run
`npx expo prebuild --clean` and reinstall/rebuild.
**Why it happens:** JS-only mental model — Expo module additions feel like `npm install` but are not.
**How to avoid:** Every task that adds one of these four packages must end with a
`checkpoint:human-verify` step: "rebuild the dev client on your own device and confirm the app
launches before continuing."
**Warning signs:** `expo-image-manipulator`/`expo-crypto` throwing "Cannot find native module" at
runtime only (TypeScript compiles fine, Jest unit tests mock the module and pass fine).

### Pitfall 2: `expo-file-system` API split (legacy vs new)
**What goes wrong:** SDK 54+ (and this project is on SDK 57) ships both a new `File`/`Directory`
class API and a `expo-file-system/legacy` namespace with the old `uploadAsync`/`documentDirectory`
functions. Mixing imports (`import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system"` for one call and
`.../legacy` for another) leads to confusing runtime behavior since the top-level export is the
*new* API, not the old one.
**Why it happens:** most existing StackOverflow/blog examples predate SDK 54 and import the old
top-level API, which now silently resolves to different types.
**How to avoid:** pick one namespace for this phase (`.../legacy` recommended, see Alternatives
Considered) and use it consistently in every file touched by L12.
**Warning signs:** `FileSystem.documentDirectory` being `undefined` (new API renamed it to
`Paths.document`).

### Pitfall 3: Retry-cap fix changes user-visible behavior for existing `sync_blocked` surveys
**What goes wrong:** Once the `??`/`false` bug is fixed, surveys that have been silently retrying
forever (some possibly already on real devices, if this build ever shipped) will, on the very next
sync attempt, immediately jump straight past `reachedRetryCap` since `retry_count` may already be
far above 8 — flipping many surveys to `sync_blocked` in one pass instead of gradually.
**Why it happens:** the bug fix is correct, but it changes behavior for state that already
accumulated incorrectly.
**How to avoid:** as part of the SQLite migration (Pattern 4), consider a one-time
`UPDATE sync_queue SET retry_count = MIN(retry_count, 8)` normalization, or explicitly decide (owner
decision — see Open Questions) whether surviving over-retried rows should be reset to retry_count=0
(give them a fresh 8 attempts) or capped immediately (treat as already exhausted).
**Warning signs:** a spike of newly `sync_blocked` surveys immediately after the update ships.

### Pitfall 4: `op_type` backfill from JSON shape must be lossless
**What goes wrong:** the migration derives `op_type` from the existing JSON payload shape
(`isSurveyQueuePayload`, `isAttachmentQueuePayload`, etc. — these type guards already exist in
`utils.ts` and are exactly what the migration should reuse). Any queue row with a JSON shape the
guards don't recognize should be surfaced as an error, not silently defaulted to a guess.
**How to avoid:** during migration, use the existing discriminator functions (`isSurveyQueuePayload`
etc.) rather than writing new heuristics; log/flag any row that matches none of them instead of
guessing.

### Pitfall 5: `terminalOverride: true` (invalid payload / invalid attachment response) is correct today
**What goes wrong:** don't "fix" every `terminalOverride` call site uniformly — `sync.ts:774`
(`Invalid sync payload`) and `sync.ts:842` (`Invalid attachment sync response`) are genuinely
client-side-detected fatal conditions that should always terminate regardless of retry count. Only
the `false` usages (network/5xx catch, and the retryable-error branch) are the bug.
**How to avoid:** when refactoring to the tri-state classification (Pattern 3), map these two sites
to `classification: "fatal"`, not remove their special-casing.

## Code Examples

### Timeout-safe fetch already exists — route `sync.ts` through it
```typescript
// Source: mobile/src/api/client.ts (already correct, confirmed lines 63-115)
// apiRequest() already has AbortController-based timeout (default 15s,
// EXPO_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS override) and typed ApiError. sync.ts's raw
// `fetch(`${apiUrl}/sync`, ...)` (line 783) and `fetch(buildSyncChangesUrl(...))`
// (line 954) bypass this entirely — this is the literal ARCH-5 finding
// ("syncPending appelle fetch directement au lieu de passer par api/client.ts").
// Fix: replace both raw fetch() calls with apiRequest<SyncBatchResponse>({...}).
```

### Streaming attachment upload with expo-file-system (legacy namespace)
```typescript
// Pattern for mobile/src/storage/sync.ts::uploadFileDirect replacement
// Source: pattern derived from docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem-legacy
// (confirmed via WebFetch 2026-09-25; verify exact option names against SDK 57 docs at plan time)
import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system/legacy"

async function uploadFileDirect(uploadTarget: string, payload: AttachmentQueuePayload) {
  const result = await FileSystem.uploadAsync(uploadTarget, payload.local_uri, {
    httpMethod: "PUT",
    uploadType: FileSystem.FileSystemUploadType.BINARY_CONTENT,
    headers: { "Content-Type": payload.mime_type },
  })
  return { ok: result.status >= 200 && result.status < 300, status: result.status }
}
```

### Resize + persist at capture time
```typescript
// Pattern for the capture flow in useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.ts
// Source: expo-image-manipulator + expo-file-system, verify exact manipulate() API
// signature against SDK 57 docs at plan time (flagged ASSUMED above)
import { ImageManipulator, SaveFormat } from "expo-image-manipulator"
import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system/legacy"
import { randomUUID } from "expo-crypto"

async function captureAndPersist(sourceUri: string): Promise<{ uri: string; sizeBytes: number }> {
  const context = ImageManipulator.manipulate(sourceUri)
  context.resize({ width: 2048 }) // long-edge resize per roadmap criterion 5
  const image = await context.renderAsync()
  const result = await image.saveAsync({ format: SaveFormat.JPEG, compress: 0.7 })

  const destDir = `${FileSystem.documentDirectory}attachments/`
  await FileSystem.makeDirectoryAsync(destDir, { intermediates: true }).catch(() => undefined)
  const destUri = `${destDir}${randomUUID()}.jpg`
  await FileSystem.copyAsync({ from: result.uri, to: destUri })

  const info = await FileSystem.getInfoAsync(destUri, { size: true })
  const sizeBytes = info.exists && "size" in info ? info.size : 0
  return { uri: destUri, sizeBytes }
}
```

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `expo-file-system` top-level `uploadAsync`/`documentDirectory` as the only API | New `File`/`Directory` class API at the top-level export, old API moved to `expo-file-system/legacy` | SDK 54 (per Expo blog, confirmed via WebSearch 2026-09-25) | Must explicitly import `.../legacy` to keep using the simpler callback-free API this phase's examples assume; the top-level import now resolves to different types |
| `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(uri, actions[], options)` | Context API: `ImageManipulator.manipulate(uri).resize(...).renderAsync()` then `.saveAsync()` | Introduced alongside recent SDK lines (exact SDK version not independently confirmed this session) | Confirm exact API surface via Context7/official docs before writing the plan's code — flagged ASSUMED |

**Deprecated/outdated:**
- `expo-file-system` legacy `uploadAsync`: still supported in SDK 57 under the `/legacy` subpath,
  not yet removed, but is the deprecated path going forward — acceptable for this phase, revisit in
  a future SDK-upgrade phase.

## Assumptions Log

| # | Claim | Section | Risk if Wrong |
|---|-------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | `expo-image-manipulator` SDK 57's primary API is the `manipulate().renderAsync().saveAsync()` context form, and the legacy `manipulateAsync` free function is still present but deprecated | Standard Stack (Alternatives), Code Examples | Low — either API achieves the same resize/compress result; wrong call signature is caught immediately by TypeScript/Jest, not a silent runtime issue |
| A2 | `expo-file-system` legacy `uploadAsync`'s exact option name is `uploadType: FileSystemUploadType.BINARY_CONTENT` (vs. some other enum/casing) in SDK 57 specifically | Code Examples | Low — caught at compile time; verify against Context7/official docs during planning before writing the real task |
| A3 | No owner has yet decided whether pre-existing over-retried `sync_queue` rows should be reset to `retry_count=0` or capped-in-place when the retry-cap bug fix ships | Common Pitfalls #3 | Medium — affects how many surveys flip to `sync_blocked` in one release; needs an explicit owner decision, not a research-time guess |

**If this table is empty:** N/A — see rows above.

## Open Questions (RESOLVED)

Resolved 2026-09-25, see 06-CONTEXT.md: Q1 → D-01 (download endpoint in this phase); Q2 → D-06 (reset retry_count to 0, owner choice, not the research recommendation); Q3 → D-12 (planner verifies the manipulator API). Delivery in a single phase with one device check (D-02, owner choice).

1. **Roadmap success criterion 6 requires a presigned-URL attachment download endpoint that does not exist in the API today.**
   - What we know: `GET /surveys/{id}/attachments` (confirmed in `api-contract-v1.md` and
     `api/src/surveys/surveys.controller.ts:99-101`) returns only `id`, `storage_key`, `mime_type`,
     `size_bytes`, `created_at`, `uploaded_at` — **no download URL field**. There is no
     `GET .../attachments/:id/download` route. `surveys-attachments.service.ts` already imports
     `getSignedUrl` from `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` (used today only for the upload target), so
     the primitive to generate a presigned GET exists in the same file.
   - What's unclear: whether the owner wants this phase to add a minimal endpoint/field (small,
     additive change to `api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts` +
     `surveys.controller.ts`) now, ahead of the full `StorageService` unification planned for Phase
     01.6, or whether criterion 6 should be descoped to "displayable once 01.6 ships" for this
     phase.
   - Recommendation: add the minimal endpoint now (reuse the existing `getSignedUrl` call site,
     ~20-30 lines), since blocking a whole roadmap criterion on a future phase contradicts the
     roadmap's own sequencing (01.5 gates Phase 7, 01.6 does not). This is the one unavoidable `api/`
     touch in an otherwise mobile-only phase — call it out explicitly in the plan so file-touch
     review isn't surprised by it. In local (non-MinIO) mode, the "download URL" can be the same API
     route the local file is already served from — verify `objectStorageMode === "local"` handling
     alongside the MinIO presigned-GET path.

2. **Retry-cap fix migration behavior for already-over-retried rows (Pitfall 3).**
   - What we know: the bug means `retry_count` may already be well above 8 on some queue rows
     without them ever having been marked `sync_blocked`.
   - What's unclear: reset to 0 (give a fresh 8 attempts) vs. treat current count as already past
     cap (immediate `sync_blocked` on next sync attempt).
   - Recommendation: treat as already past cap (simpler migration, matches "the cap should have
     already applied" framing) but surface this as an owner decision in CONTEXT.md before planning,
     since it changes user-visible state (some surveys will suddenly show as blocked).

3. **`expo-image-manipulator` exact SDK 57 API surface (Assumption A1/A2).**
   - What we know: the context-based `manipulate()` API exists in recent SDK lines; the free
     function `manipulateAsync` is the older pattern.
   - What's unclear: whether SDK 57 has fully removed `manipulateAsync` or kept it deprecated-but-
     present, and the exact `.resize()`/`.saveAsync()` option names.
   - Recommendation: planner should do one Context7/official-docs lookup for `expo-image-manipulator`
     scoped to SDK 57 before writing the exact task code — this research session flags it rather
     than asserting an unverified signature as fact.

## Environment Availability

| Dependency | Required By | Available | Version | Fallback |
|------------|--------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Node.js | build/test | ✓ | (repo requires 20+, assumed present in dev env) | — |
| `node:sqlite` (Node 22+) | `mobile/test/node-sqlite-db.ts` real-SQL test harness | ✓ (per existing test infra, already in use since Phase 01.2/01.3) | Node 22+ | — |
| Expo dev client on a physical/simulated device | Every task adding a new native module (expo-crypto, expo-file-system, expo-image, expo-image-manipulator); offline cold-start device check | ✗ (not verifiable from this research session — requires the owner's own device) | — | `checkpoint:human-verify` before/after each native-module task; CI/unit tests cannot substitute for a real device rebuild |
| PostgreSQL (test DB) | Not required for this phase — mobile-only unit/renderHook tests; the one new API endpoint (Open Question 1) would need `npm run test:e2e` against `ibp_test` if added | ✓ (per project setup) | 16 | — |

**Missing dependencies with no fallback:**
- Owner device access for native-module rebuild verification — no CI substitute exists for "does
  the dev client actually launch and can I capture/upload a photo end-to-end."

**Missing dependencies with fallback:**
- None beyond the device-check item above.

## Validation Architecture

### Test Framework
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Framework | Jest 29 + ts-jest, `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` |
| Config file | `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` (coverage ratchet, see below) |
| Quick run command | `npm run test:unit -- --selectProjects mobile` (or `cd mobile && npx jest <pattern>`) |
| Full suite command | `npm run test:unit` (mobile + api) |

### Phase Requirements → Test Map
| Req ID | Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists? |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| REQ-AUD-sync-engine | Single-flight: two concurrent `runSync`/`syncPending` triggers produce exactly one `POST /sync` | unit (renderHook + fetch mock spy) | `cd mobile && npx jest useSurveySync.test.ts -t "single"` | ❌ Wave 0 — new spec needed |
| REQ-AUD-sync-engine | 250 queued operations sync in exactly 3 batches of ≤100 | unit (real SQLite via `node-sqlite-db.ts`) | `cd mobile && npx jest sync.test.ts -t "batch"` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-sync-engine | Retry cap: 8 consecutive network/5xx failures on one row flip it to `sync_blocked`; a fatal (422) blocks after 1 attempt | unit (real SQLite) | `cd mobile && npx jest sync.test.ts -t "retry cap"` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-sync-engine | Pull never overwrites a survey with a pending or `sync_blocked` local row | unit (real SQLite) | `cd mobile && npx jest sync.test.ts -t "pull"` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-sync-engine | Autosave in-flight reschedules instead of skipping | unit (renderHook, fake timers) | `cd mobile && npx jest useEditingDraft.test.ts` | ✅ file likely exists (`useEditingDraft.ts` has no `.test.ts` confirmed sibling — verify at plan time) |
| REQ-AUD-local-storage | Migration from a v0 (un-versioned) real SQLite DB to latest `user_version` preserves all rows | unit (real SQLite, seeded with pre-migration schema) | `cd mobile && npx jest db.test.ts -t "migration"` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-local-storage | A thrown error mid-`updateLocalDraft` leaves the DB in its pre-transaction state | unit (real SQLite, forced failure) | `cd mobile && npx jest surveys.test.ts -t "transaction"` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-photos | Resize is invoked with 2048px/0.7 JPEG on capture; result copied to `documentDirectory` | unit (mocked `expo-image-manipulator`/`expo-file-system`) | `cd mobile && npx jest useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts -t "resize"` | ❌ Wave 0 (mock modules needed — see gaps) |
| REQ-AUD-photos | Network error during upload does not increment the attachment retry cap | unit (real SQLite) | `cd mobile && npx jest sync.test.ts -t "attachment retry"` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-photos | Missing local file surfaces a terminal, user-visible error instead of silent deletion | unit | `cd mobile && npx jest sync.test.ts -t "missing file"` | ❌ Wave 0 |
| REQ-AUD-offline-start | Valid stored credentials + unreachable `/me` yields `isAuthenticated=true` with cached profile, not the login overlay | unit (renderHook, `useAuth0Session.test.ts`) | `cd mobile && npx jest useAuth0Session.test.ts -t "offline"` | ❌ Wave 0 (existing file `useAuth0Session.ts` almost certainly has a `.test.ts` sibling already — extend it, verify path at plan time) |

### Sampling Rate
- **Per task commit:** targeted `npx jest <changed-file-pattern>` in `mobile/`
- **Per wave merge:** `npm run test:unit` (full mobile + api unit suite) — coverage ratchet in
  `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` must not regress (`./src/storage/`: 56/35/68/58,
  `./src/hooks/`: 82/65/80/83 — these are floors, this phase should raise them since it adds
  substantial new tested code in exactly these two directories)
- **Phase gate:** full suite green before `/gsd:verify-work`, **plus** the device-check items in
  Environment Availability (native rebuild, offline cold-start, on-device photo capture/upload)
  since none of those are exercisable by Jest against `node:sqlite`/mocked native modules

### Wave 0 Gaps
- [ ] `mobile/test/expo-image-manipulator.mock.ts` — new mock, module not yet referenced anywhere in `moduleNameMapper`
- [ ] `mobile/test/expo-file-system.mock.ts` — new mock (legacy namespace)
- [ ] `mobile/test/expo-crypto.mock.ts` — new mock (deterministic UUID for test assertions)
- [ ] `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` — add the three new `moduleNameMapper` entries above
- [ ] Confirm whether `useSurveySyncSurveyOperations.test.ts` and `useAuth0Session.test.ts` already
      exist as test files (both source files clearly have production logic that should already be
      tested per the coverage ratchet — verify exact current coverage before assuming a gap)

## Security Domain

### Applicable ASVS Categories

| ASVS Category | Applies | Standard Control |
|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| V2 Authentication | Partial | No change to Auth0 flow itself; cached-profile-on-cold-start must not weaken the existing `AUTH_REQUIRED` vs `AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE` classification from Phase 01.2 — cached profile is a *display* convenience, `syncAllowed`/write-gating logic must still require a valid token before any write |
| V6 Cryptography | No | No new cryptographic primitive introduced; `expo-crypto`'s `randomUUID()` uses the platform CSPRNG, not hand-rolled |
| V8 Data Protection | Yes | Cached "last known profile" for offline cold-start must be stored in the same trust tier as existing local data (SQLite `local_meta`, not a new unencrypted plaintext file) — do not introduce a new storage location with weaker guarantees than what Auth0's `credentialsManager` already provides for the tokens themselves |
| V5 Input Validation | No new surface | Not applicable — this phase touches storage/sync internals, not new user input |

### Known Threat Patterns for this stack

| Pattern | STRIDE | Standard Mitigation |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| Cached profile used to bypass real authentication after logout/account switch | Spoofing | Explicitly clear the cached profile on `clearSession`/`performLogoutAndPurge` (Phase 01.2's D-02/D-03 already gate local-data purge on explicit logout confirmation — extend the same clear-on-explicit-logout path to the new cached-profile field, never clear it on a mere `AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE`) |
| Presigned download URL (Open Question 1) leaking access to another user's attachment if the survey ownership check is missed on the new endpoint | Elevation of Privilege | Reuse the exact same ownership check already enforced on `GET /surveys/{id}/attachments` — do not add a new unauthenticated or ownership-unchecked route |

- `slopcheck install` (2026-09-25) — all four packages `[OK]`

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)
- `docs/audits/audit-2026-09-code-complet.md` findings M-H1, M-H2, M-H4, M-H5, ARCH-3, ARCH-5 —

- `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md`, `docs/technical/sync-conflict-resolution-v1.md` — canonical
  retry/conflict policy
- WebFetch of `docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem/` (2026-09-25) — new File API upload
  surface

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- WebSearch "expo-file-system SDK 54 legacy uploadAsync vs new File API deprecated" (2026-09-25) —
  used to establish the legacy/new split exists; exact SDK 57 behavior for
  `expo-image-manipulator`'s API surface not independently re-verified (see Assumptions A1/A2)

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH — all four packages are official Expo SDK modules, versions confirmed against the registry for the installed SDK line
- Architecture (current-state findings): HIGH — every finding was re-verified by reading the actual current code, not just quoting the audit text
- Architecture (new code patterns, exact API signatures for expo-image-manipulator/expo-file-system): MEDIUM — pattern-correct but exact method names should get one more Context7/official-docs pass at plan time
- Pitfalls: HIGH — derived directly from confirmed code defects, not speculation
- Open Question 1 (attachment download endpoint gap): HIGH confidence that the gap exists; MEDIUM confidence on the recommended remedy since it's an owner-scope decision, not a technical one

**Research date:** 2026-09-25
**Valid until:** 2026-10-25 (30 days — Expo SDK ecosystem moves fast; re-verify package versions if planning is delayed)
