    - "createSyncFlight()'s run(kind, task) loop: same-kind callers join the in-flight promise; a different-kind caller awaits (swallowing errors) the current flight and re-checks, so several same-kind waiters queued behind an other-kind flight collapse into one fresh task once it starts"
    - "sync.ts's guarded export is a thin non-async function returning syncFlight.run(kind, () => privateBody(...)); the private body calls the *other* private body directly (drainQueue -> pullChanges, never the guarded pullRemoteChanges) to avoid deadlocking on its own flight"
    - "Per-result processing inside the chunked drain wraps only the local-write call (markSurveyQueueRowSynced/markSurveyDeleteRowSynced/markAttachmentDeleteRowSynced) in try/catch: a rollback increments `failed` and leaves the row for the next run, without touching it again (touching it again could hit the same trigger/constraint twice)"

  - "The three failure handlers, mark-synced/delete-synced, and the attachment-delete synced branch each open their own runInTransaction (no shared parent), since none of them run while another transaction is open — this keeps every writer a simple top-level call and avoids ever needing runInTransaction(fn, tx) joins inside sync.ts"
  - "uploadAttachmentAndMarkSynced still performs the network upload + confirm PUT before opening its transaction: the transaction covers only the local DB tail (DELETE queue row + UPDATE local_attachments), consistent with D-17's 'never hold a transaction across network I/O'"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 10: Single-flight sync engine, chunked drain, atomic writers Summary

**A module-level single flight (`createSyncFlight`) makes `syncPending`/`pullRemoteChanges` mutually exclusive and de-duplicating, `drainQueue` now sends `POST /sync` in `SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` (100) chunks with a stop-on-batch-failure rule, `markSurveyQueueRowSynced` only flips a survey to `synced` when its `sync_queue` is empty, and every multi-statement writer in `sync.ts` (mark-synced, delete-synced, the three failure handlers, visibility queueing, the attachment-upload DB tail, each pulled page + its cursor) now runs inside `runInTransaction`.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~20 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 4 (3 created, 1 modified)

## Accomplishments
- `mobile/src/storage/sync-flight.ts` exports `createSyncFlight()`: a `run(kind, task)` loop where same-kind callers join the currently running task's promise, and a caller of the other kind waits (swallowing rejection) for the current flight before starting its own — proven with 7 deferred-promise behaviours (same-kind join x2, cross-kind serialisation both directions, a three-waiter collapse into exactly one fresh task, rejection propagation + flight clearing, no stale caching after settle).
- `sync.ts` renames its old bodies to private `drainQueue`/`pullChanges`; the exported `syncPending`/`pullRemoteChanges` are now `syncFlight.run("sync"|"pull", ...)` wrappers. `drainQueue` calls `pullChanges` directly at its end (never the guarded `pullRemoteChanges`) so its own opportunistic pull doesn't deadlock on the flight it's running under. `updateSurveyVisibility` keeps calling the guarded `syncPending` export (C5), so it joins an in-flight drain instead of racing it.
- The queue snapshot now selects `op_type` and the operations array is sent in `SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` (100) chunks, in ascending queue-id order. A non-auth batch-level failure (network error, malformed response) marks that chunk's rows via the classified failure handlers and stops the loop — later chunks are left completely untouched for the next drain. An auth (401/403) failure still rethrows immediately, leaving every row untouched for `withAuthRetry`.
- `markSurveyQueueRowSynced` deletes the queue row and updates `local_surveys` in one transaction, guarded by `... WHERE id = ? AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM sync_queue WHERE survey_id = ?)` — a survey with another row still queued (a later batch, or one that just failed) never gets marked `synced`.
- Every multi-statement writer is now transactional: `markSurveyQueueRowSynced`, `markSurveyDeleteRowSynced`, a new `markAttachmentDeleteRowSynced`, the local-DB tail of `uploadAttachmentAndMarkSynced` (network calls stay outside the transaction), the three failure handlers (`handleSurveySyncFailure`/`handleAttachmentSyncFailure`/`handleAttachmentDeleteSyncFailure`), `queueSurveyVisibilityChange` (now also tagging its INSERT with `op_type = 'survey_visibility'`), and `pullChanges`'s per-page `applyRemoteChanges(tx, ...)` + cursor `setMetaValue(tx, ...)` pairing. The three "mark synced" write calls inside the drain's per-result loop are individually wrapped in try/catch: a rolled-back write (e.g. an aborted `UPDATE local_surveys`) counts that operation as `failed` and leaves the queue row untouched for the next run, instead of throwing out of the whole drain.
- `applyRemoteChanges`/`getMetaValue`/`setMetaValue`/`getLocalAttachmentById`/`saveAttachmentUploadTarget` are retyped from `SQLite.SQLiteDatabase` to `DbExecutor` (from `./transaction`), so the same functions work whether called with the raw db or a `TxHandle`.
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.engine.sqlite.test.ts` adds 11 real-SQL proofs: one `POST /sync` for two concurrent `syncPending` calls, `updateSurveyVisibility` joining an in-flight drain, a pull's `GET /sync/changes` starting only after a concurrent sync resolves, 250 operations chunking into 100/100/50 batches with every row synced, a batch-level network failure stopping the remaining chunks, the cross-batch and mixed-result synced-only-when-empty guards, an aborted `UPDATE local_surveys` rolling back mark-synced without crashing the drain, `updateSurveyVisibility`'s `op_type` tag and its own rollback-leaves-no-row-behind case, a full drain+pull running under the real transaction mutex without a reentrancy rejection, and a pulled page's cursor staying unchanged when its survey INSERT is aborted.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: sync-flight.ts single-flight primitive** - `fe46e87` (feat, tests included per TDD)
2. **Task 2: Guarded entry points, chunked drain, synced-only-when-empty, transactional writers** - `4e0c010` (feat, tests included per TDD)

_Both tasks were `tdd="true"`; test files were authored alongside the implementation in each commit._

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/storage/sync-flight.ts` - `createSyncFlight()` single-flight primitive (D-03)
- `mobile/src/storage/sync-flight.test.ts` - 7 deferred-promise behaviour tests
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts` - guarded `syncPending`/`pullRemoteChanges` over private `drainQueue`/`pullChanges`; `SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` chunking with stop-on-batch-failure; `NOT EXISTS` synced guard; every multi-statement writer wrapped in `runInTransaction`; `queueSurveyVisibilityChange` tags `op_type = 'survey_visibility'`
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.engine.sqlite.test.ts` - 11 real-SQL engine proofs (single flight, chunking, synced-only-when-empty, atomic writers, pull-page + cursor atomicity, reentrancy)

## Decisions Made
- A batch-level failure stops remaining chunks entirely rather than marking them failed too, so a transient network blip during a large drain doesn't burn retry attempts on operations the server never even saw.
- Rollback-and-continue is scoped to just the three "mark synced" write calls per result (not the whole synced-branch, which already has its own upload-failure handling) to avoid double-counting a failure when an upload's own catch block also fails.
- Kept every `sync.ts` transaction as a standalone top-level `runInTransaction` call (no `runInTransaction(fn, tx)` joins needed) since no writer in this file runs while another one's transaction is still open — this keeps the reentrancy-guard surface area in `sync.ts` at zero.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written. The interfaces section's line-number references had shifted by the time this plan ran (as plan 08's summary warned they might); no functional deviation resulted.

## Issues Encountered
- Initial draft of `resolveFailureOutcome` used an inline `require("./db")` to read `MAX_RETRY_COUNT` (a stray artifact from iterating on the file) — caught by re-reading the diff before running lint; fixed to a normal top-level `import { MAX_RETRY_COUNT } from "./db"` before the first lint/typecheck pass, so no lint failure was ever committed.
- Prettier reformatted `sync.ts` and the new engine test file after the initial TDD pass (long argument lists); re-ran the full lint/typecheck/test/coverage/format suite afterward to confirm no regressions.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 11 (streaming attachment upload/download integration) can build on `sync.ts`'s writers already being transactional and its network calls already being isolated from any transaction (D-17's "never hold a transaction across network I/O" is now consistently true for every writer touched here).
- `submitSurvey` was intentionally left untouched (single-statement writes, not in this plan's `<action>` scope); a future plan can transactionalize it if it grows multi-statement writes.
- Full mobile suite from the worktree: 56 test suites / 745 tests pass; `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` all clean (exit 0) at the repo root, run from this worktree's root as required. Coverage thresholds (including the `./src/storage/` ratchet) hold.
