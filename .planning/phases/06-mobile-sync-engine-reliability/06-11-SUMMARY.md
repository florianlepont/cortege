# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "buildUploadFailureOptions(error): a small classification helper in sync.ts that special-cases LocalFileMissingError (fatal + errorCode local_file_missing + markFileMissing: true) ahead of the generic classifyUploadFailure(error) path, used at both attachment-upload failure sites (post-create and upload-only rows) instead of duplicating the LocalFileMissingError check"
    - "applyRemoteChanges collects deleted rows' local_uri into a deletedFileUris array returned alongside its counts; the caller (pullChanges) deletes those files with FileSystem only after runInTransaction resolves, so a rolled-back page never loses a file it didn't actually delete from the DB"
    - "deriveAttachmentErrorCode checks the 'retry cap reached' substring before any UPLOAD_HTTP/CONFIRM_HTTP-code branch, so an unknown-classified failure that reaches MAX_RETRY_COUNT is always reported as retry_cap_reached even when its message also carries an HTTP code (e.g. eight capped 401s)"

    - mobile/src/storage/sync.ts
    - mobile/src/storage/utils.ts

key-decisions:
  - "handleAttachmentSyncFailure grew an optional markFileMissing flag on its existing FailureOptions type rather than a separate function, so the missing-file write happens inside the same runInTransaction call as the queue-row/attachment failure writes (no second top-level transaction, consistent with plan 03's reentrancy guard)"
  - "File cleanup for survey/attachment deletes reads local_uri values with a SELECT inside the same transaction that performs the DELETE, then calls deleteAttachmentFile (best-effort, errors swallowed) only after the transaction promise resolves — mirrors the D-17 'never let network/file I/O block a transaction' pattern already used for the upload call itself"
  - "deriveAttachmentErrorCode's retry-cap check was moved to the top of the function (a pre-existing ordering bug: 'HTTP 401 | retry cap reached' matched the HTTP 401 branch first) — in scope as a Rule 1 fix because the plan's own acceptance behavior (UPLOAD_HTTP 401 x8 -> retry_cap_reached) exercises exactly this path"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 11: Stream attachment uploads, surface missing files, free deleted photos Summary

**`uploadAttachmentAndMarkSynced` now streams every photo from disk through `uploadAttachmentFile` (MULTIPART+bearer for the API route, BINARY_CONTENT for a presigned target, 120s cancellation) instead of loading it into a blob; a missing local file is recorded as `file_state: 'missing'` without deleting the row or blocking the survey; and a confirmed survey delete or a pulled attachment delete frees the cached photo file only after its transaction commits.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~35 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 3 (1 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments
- `sync.ts`'s only upload path is now `uploadAttachmentFile({ uploadTarget, isApiUploadTarget, localUri, mimeType, accessToken })` (D-15): the old `uploadFileViaApi`/`uploadFileDirect` fetch/FormData/blob helpers are deleted along with the `LOCAL_FILE_HTTP` error code they produced. `global.fetch` is no longer called with a `file://` uri anywhere in the sync engine.
- A `LocalFileMissingError` thrown by `uploadAttachmentFile` is classified fatal with `errorCode: "local_file_missing"` and, in the very same `runInTransaction` as the queue-row deletion and the attachment's failure write, `markAttachmentFileMissing(tx, ...)` flips the row's `file_state` to `'missing'` (D-10). The row is never deleted, `sync_blocked` on the survey stays 0, and this is proven identically for a fresh attachment-create result and for an upload-only row (a remote id + upload_url already saved from a prior run).
- Every other upload failure path is unchanged in its classification (network TypeError, an upload that never settles past `UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`, UPLOAD_HTTP 5xx/429 all stay `retryable` and never touch `retry_count`; UPLOAD_HTTP 401/403 count toward the cap; UPLOAD_HTTP 400/404/409/410/413/415/422 are fatal on the first attempt) — `buildUploadFailureOptions` centralizes the one LocalFileMissingError special case ahead of the existing `classifyUploadFailure`.
- `markSurveyDeleteRowSynced` and both of `applyRemoteChanges`'s remote-delete branches (a deleted survey pulling down, a deleted attachment pulling down) now collect the doomed rows' `local_uri` values inside their transaction and call `deleteAttachmentFile` on each only once the transaction has committed — a rolled-back delete never loses a file it never actually removed from the DB (D-09).
- Fixed a latent ordering bug in `deriveAttachmentErrorCode`: the `"retry cap reached"` substring check ran after the `UPLOAD_HTTP 401`/`403`/etc. branches, so a failure that had both an HTTP code and had just reached the retry cap (e.g. eight capped 401s) was reported as `unauthorized` instead of `retry_cap_reached`. Moved the cap check to the top of the function (D-14).

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Real-SQL tests for the streaming upload path** - `59073fa` (test, RED against the pre-existing fetch/blob path)
2. **Task 2: Stream uploads through uploadAttachmentFile, surface missing files, clean files after deletions** - `0e5cdb7` (feat, GREEN)

_Task 1 was `tdd="true"`; the test file was authored first and confirmed to fail against the fetch/blob implementation before Task 2's implementation changes made it pass._

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.attachments.sqlite.test.ts` - 12 real-SQL proofs: API-route vs presigned upload targets (streaming, headers, no blob), fresh and upload-only missing-file handling, network/timeout/5xx/429 never counting toward the cap, UPLOAD_HTTP 401 reaching the cap and UPLOAD_HTTP 404 being fatal immediately, and file cleanup after a confirmed survey delete and a pulled attachment delete
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts` - `uploadAttachmentAndMarkSynced` calls `uploadAttachmentFile`; `uploadFileViaApi`/`uploadFileDirect` removed; `FailureOptions.markFileMissing` + `buildUploadFailureOptions`; `handleAttachmentSyncFailure` marks the attachment row missing in-transaction; `applyRemoteChanges` returns `deletedFileUris`; `markSurveyDeleteRowSynced` and `pullChanges` delete freed files post-commit
- `mobile/src/storage/utils.ts` - `deriveAttachmentErrorCode`: removed the dead `LOCAL_FILE_HTTP 404` branch, added a `"Local file missing"` mapping to `local_file_missing`, moved the `retry cap reached` check to the top

## Decisions Made
- See `key-decisions` in the frontmatter above: the `markFileMissing` flag on `FailureOptions` (keeps the missing-file write inside the existing transaction rather than opening a second one), the post-commit-only file deletion pattern for both delete paths, and the `deriveAttachmentErrorCode` ordering fix.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] `deriveAttachmentErrorCode` reported `unauthorized` instead of `retry_cap_reached` for a capped UPLOAD_HTTP 401**
- **Found during:** Task 2, running the Task 1 test "UPLOAD_HTTP 401 eight times: row deleted at the 8th, attachment failed with retry_cap_reached"
- **Issue:** `deriveAttachmentErrorCode`'s `UPLOAD_HTTP 401` branch ran before its `"retry cap reached"` substring check, so the final message `"UPLOAD_HTTP 401 | retry cap reached (8)"` matched the HTTP-code branch first.
- **Fix:** Moved the `"retry cap reached"` check to the top of `deriveAttachmentErrorCode`, and removed the now-unreachable duplicate check at the bottom of the function.
- **Files modified:** `mobile/src/storage/utils.ts`
- **Verification:** The Task 1 test now passes; full mobile suite (757 tests) still green.
- **Committed in:** `0e5cdb7` (part of Task 2's commit)

No other deviations — the plan's `<action>` steps for both tasks were followed as written.

## Issues Encountered
- The Task 1 test file initially left an extra `survey_upsert` queue row from `createLocalDraft` uncleaned in most attachment-only test cases, making `getQueueRowCount(draft.id)` return 1 instead of 0 after a successful/failed attachment sync. Fixed by adding a `dropSurveyUpsertQueueRow` helper called after every `queueLocalAttachment` in the test file, so each case exercises only the attachment operation it targets.
- One test's `INSERT INTO local_attachments` was missing a placeholder value for `local_uri` (column/parameter count mismatch caught by the real SQL driver as a `NOT NULL constraint failed: local_attachments.updated_at` error, since every following param shifted by one) — fixed before the first RED run was accepted as intentional.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 12 can build on `sync.ts`'s attachment upload path being fully streaming with no `fetch`/blob code left in the file, and on `local_attachments.file_state = 'missing'` being a reachable, tested state distinct from `'unavailable'`/`'remote'`/`'local'`.
- Full mobile suite from this worktree: 57 test suites / 757 tests pass; `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` all exit 0 (coverage thresholds, including the `./src/storage/` ratchet, hold — `sync.ts` alone is at 86.72% statements / 72.08% branches / 87.8% functions / 87.64% lines).
- `mobile/src/storage/attachments.ts`'s `uploadAttachmentFile` and `mobile/src/storage/attachment-cache.ts`'s `markAttachmentFileMissing` are now both consumed by `sync.ts` in addition to their original callers (`attachment-cache.ts`'s on-demand download path), so any future change to either function's signature must account for the sync-engine call sites added here.
