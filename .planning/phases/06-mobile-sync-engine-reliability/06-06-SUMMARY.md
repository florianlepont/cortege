    - "Never-delete-the-row cache miss handling: 404/409 -> file_state 'unavailable' (server has no bytes, stop asking); local file gone + no remote copy -> file_state 'missing' (D-10); any other failure leaves the row unchanged for a later retry"
    - "Session-scoped request de-duplication in a hook: an in-flight Set reserved synchronously before any await, a 'local rows checked once' Set, and an 'unavailable per updated_at' Set, feeding a small worker-pool loop bounded by MAX_CONCURRENT_ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOADS"

key-decisions:
  - "ensureAttachmentCached treats file_state 'remote' and a file-state-'local'-but-file-missing row identically once it needs to (re)download: both fall through to the same download attempt gated on remote_attachment_id being present, so a lost local copy and a never-cached pulled attachment share one code path"
  - "The 401 branch from getAttachmentDownloadUrl is rethrown (not swallowed) so the existing withAuthRetry wrapper in the hook can refresh the token and retry the whole ensureAttachmentCached call, matching the pattern used by every other authenticated call site in this codebase"
  - "'changed' (whether to call refreshLocalAttachments) is computed per the plan's literal wording: 'ready' only counts when the row was 'remote' before the call; 'missing' and 'unavailable' always count. A local row whose file already existed and stayed 'ready' does not trigger a refresh"

patterns-established:
  - "AttachmentPreviewResult (\"ready\" | \"remote\" | \"missing\" | \"unavailable\") as the vocabulary any future caller of ensureAttachmentCached reasons about, mirroring AttachmentFileState from plan 03"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 06: Mobile server-photo display Summary

**A pulled attachment's bytes are now fetched on demand through the D-01 download-url endpoint, cached durably under documentDirectory/attachments/, and a lost or never-uploaded file is recorded ("missing"/"unavailable") instead of ever being deleted or retried forever — exposed to the rest of the app as one hook call, `handleEnsureAttachmentPreviews`.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~70 min
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 9 (4 created, 5 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `ibp-api.getAttachmentDownloadUrl` calls `GET /surveys/:id/attachments/:attachmentId/download-url` with both ids `encodeURIComponent`-escaped, matching the existing `loadSurveyDetail` style and test-mock convention.
- `attachment-cache.ensureAttachmentCached` is the single place that turns a `local_attachments` row into a usable local file: it never issues a network call for an `unavailable` row, returns `"ready"` immediately (with a re-based `local_uri` persisted if needed) when a `local` row's file still exists on disk, downloads through `expo-file-system/legacy`'s `downloadAsync` with a 60s timeout race, sends the `Authorization: Bearer` header only when the server says `requires_auth`, and on a 404/409 from the download-url call marks the row `unavailable` — permanently muting further requests for that exact attachment version — while a 401 is rethrown untouched so the existing `withAuthRetry` wrapper can refresh the token. A row deleted mid-download is detected via `UPDATE ... WHERE id = ?` returning `changes === 0`, and the orphan file is removed. The row itself is never deleted (`grep -c "DELETE FROM local_attachments"` = 0).
- `useAttachmentPreviews` gives screens one call, `handleEnsureAttachmentPreviews(attachments)`: it selects `remote` rows every call, `local` rows exactly once per app session, never `missing`/`unavailable`; reserves every selected id in an in-flight `Set` synchronously (before any `await`) so a second call made while the first is still running can never start a duplicate download even for a queued-but-not-yet-started id; runs at most `MAX_CONCURRENT_ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOADS = 2` downloads at once via a small worker-pool loop; remembers an `"unavailable"` result keyed by `${id}:${updated_at}` so a stale prop list cannot re-trigger it, while a pull that resets the row (new `updated_at`) makes it eligible again; and stops the whole batch silently (no throw) on `SYNC_SUSPENDED` or `AUTH_REQUIRED`, both surfaced through the existing `withAuthRetry`/`syncActivity.run` wrapping used everywhere else in the sync hooks.
- `useSurveySync` now returns `handleEnsureAttachmentPreviews` and `handleSimulateMissingAttachmentFile` (the dev-only "delete this photo's local file, keep the row" helper for plans 09/12's device check), wired the same way every other sub-hook is composed.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (TDD: tests written alongside the implementation, both verified together):

1. **Task 1: getAttachmentDownloadUrl and attachment-cache.ts with real-SQL tests** - `a83aae7` (feat)
2. **Task 2: useAttachmentPreviews hook and useSurveySync wiring** - `cbefc25` (feat)

_No plan-metadata commit yet — orchestrator owns STATE.md/ROADMAP.md updates for this parallel-executor plan._

## Files Created/Modified

- `mobile/src/api/ibp-api.ts` - `AttachmentDownloadUrlResponse` type, `getAttachmentDownloadUrl`
- `mobile/src/api/ibp-api.test.ts` - encoded-id request-shape test for the new endpoint
- `mobile/src/storage/attachment-cache.ts` - `ensureAttachmentCached`, `markAttachmentFileMissing`, `simulateMissingAttachmentFile`, `ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`, `LOCAL_FILE_MISSING_CODE`, `AttachmentPreviewResult`
- `mobile/src/storage/attachment-cache.sqlite.test.ts` - 19 real-SQL (node:sqlite) tests covering all twelve documented behaviours plus `markAttachmentFileMissing`/`simulateMissingAttachmentFile` directly
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useAttachmentPreviews.ts` - `useAttachmentPreviews`, `MAX_CONCURRENT_ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOADS`
- `mobile/src/hooks/survey-sync/useAttachmentPreviews.test.ts` - 9 renderHook tests covering all seven documented hook behaviours (selection/dedup split across two cases)
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.ts` - instantiates `useAttachmentPreviews` and returns its two handlers
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.test.ts` - mocks the new sub-hook; asserts both handlers are returned
- `mobile/src/hooks/useSurveySync.logout-purge.test.ts` - mocks the new sub-hook (this file renders the real `useSurveySync`)

## Decisions Made

- A `local`-state row whose file is missing falls through to the exact same download branch as a `remote` row (gated on `remote_attachment_id` being present) rather than a separate code path, since the destination filename (`remote-<serverId>.<ext>`) and the "no remote id -> mark missing" rule are identical either way.
- `ensureAttachmentCached`'s ApiError handling rethrows only on 401; every other status (404/409 -> unavailable, everything else including 429/5xx/503 and raw network `TypeError` -> "remote", unchanged) returns rather than throws, so a transient failure never surfaces as an unhandled rejection to the hook's per-id `try/catch`.
- `useAttachmentPreviews` reserves candidate ids in the in-flight `Set` in a separate synchronous pass *before* the worker-pool loop starts, rather than inside each worker's first iteration — this is what makes the "concurrent call does not start a second download for an id already queued but not yet running" behaviour deterministic instead of a race.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. `npm ci` was run at the worktree root because `node_modules` was absent (wave 1's added packages), per the parallel-execution instructions, not a plan deviation.

## Issues Encountered

- The full `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` run intermittently prints Jest's "did not exit one second after the test run has completed" warning only when both new test files (`attachment-cache.sqlite.test.ts` and `useAttachmentPreviews.test.ts`) run together in the same `--runInBand` process; neither file alone, nor the two combined with every other suite minus one of them, reproduces it, and `--detectOpenHandles` (the diagnostic Jest recommends) reports nothing open across three repeated runs. All 601 tests pass and the process exits with code 0 every time. Treated as a benign Jest false-positive under this specific file-ordering/load combination (a documented Jest quirk), not a real leaked handle — left as-is rather than papering over it with an unverified change, since the plan's verification step (full suite + coverage green) passes.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 09 (attachment capture and screens) can call `handleEnsureAttachmentPreviews(attachments)` from a screen effect and `handleSimulateMissingAttachmentFile(id)` from its dev tools, exactly as exposed by `useSurveySync`.
- Plan 11 (attachment integrity and purge) can call the exported `markAttachmentFileMissing(tx, id)` inside its own `runInTransaction` callback, per its `DbExecutor` signature.
- Plan 12's device check can drive the missing-file repro path via `handleSimulateMissingAttachmentFile`.
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts`'s remote-attachment-pull INSERT (plans 05/07/08's territory) does not yet explicitly set `file_state = 'remote'` on newly pulled rows — it relies on the column's schema default (`'local'`) unless a later migration/backfill applies. This plan's `ensureAttachmentCached` behaves correctly for any row already carrying `file_state = 'remote'` (as migration 1 backfills for existing rows with an empty `local_uri`), but the plans owning `sync.ts` should confirm the pull-insert path sets `file_state` explicitly for genuinely new pulled rows, not just for pre-existing ones migrated forward.
- No blockers for the rest of the phase.
