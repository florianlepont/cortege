  patterns:
    - "resolveFailureOutcome(classification, retryCount, message) in sync.ts centralizes the fatal/retryable/unknown -> {terminal, finalMessage, nextRetryCount} decision so all three failure handlers (survey, attachment, attachment-delete) share one rule instead of duplicating the retry-cap arithmetic"
    - "classifyRequestError returns FailureClassification | \"auth\" (not just FailureClassification) so a batch-level 401/403 can be rethrown untouched by its caller instead of being force-fit into fatal/retryable/unknown"
    - "sync-classification.test.ts tests the three classifiers as pure functions (no SQLite, no fetch); sync.retry.sqlite.test.ts and sync.pull.sqlite.test.ts prove the DB-level consequences with real SQL against the node:sqlite test double"

  - "The pull guard's remote-delete branch treats a survey_delete queue row as compatible with an incoming remote deletion (lets the local delete-in-flight and the remote delete converge instead of blocking each other forever), while any other queue row type or sync_blocked=1 blocks the deletion entirely"
  - "submitSurvey's non-ApiError catch branch rethrows unchanged (network/timeout-before-status errors propagate exactly as before apiRequest existed) — only ApiError instances are inspected for the expired/422/generic-failure branches, preserving the pre-existing behavior for callers"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 08: Retry cap, apiRequest timeouts, and pull guard Summary

**Replaced sync.ts's buggy `terminalOverride ?? (terminalByMessage || reachedRetryCap)` retry logic (`false ?? x` always evaluated to `false`, so the cap never fired for explicit-false callers) with a tested fatal/retryable/unknown classification that only counts ambiguous failures toward the 8-attempt cap, routed every sync JSON call through `apiRequest` (now with a body-read timeout), and added a pull guard so a remote sync can never overwrite or delete a survey with pending or blocked local work.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~90 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 8 (3 created, 5 modified)

## Accomplishments
- `utils.ts` exports a tested `FailureClassification` vocabulary (`"fatal" | "retryable" | "unknown"`) and three pure classifiers — `classifyRequestError` (batch-request-level exceptions, including "auth" for a 401/403), `classifyBatchResult` (per-operation server results), `classifyUploadFailure` (upload/confirm exceptions, covering plan 07's `LocalFileMissingError`/`UploadTimeoutError` and both the legacy `UPLOAD_HTTP <n>` string errors and apiRequest's `ApiError`) — each exercised directly in `sync-classification.test.ts` against every documented case.
- `client.ts`'s `apiRequest` now races the fetch-and-parse flow against a single timeout that spans the whole request, including the response body read (previously `clearTimeout` ran right after `fetch` resolved, so a stalled body read could hang indefinitely); proven with a fake-timers test where `response.text()` never resolves.
- `sync.ts`'s three failure handlers (`handleSurveySyncFailure`, `handleAttachmentSyncFailure`, `handleAttachmentDeleteSyncFailure`) now take a required `{ classification, errorCode? }` and share one `resolveFailureOutcome` helper: `"fatal"` deletes the queue row and blocks (`sync_blocked = 1`) on the first attempt; `"retryable"` never touches `retry_count` and never blocks (network errors, timeouts, and 5xx/429 responses no longer consume the cap — D-14); `"unknown"` increments `retry_count` and, once it reaches `MAX_RETRY_COUNT` (8), is treated as fatal with a `"retry cap reached (8)"` message so `deriveSurveyErrorCode`/`deriveAttachmentErrorCode` naturally produce `retry_cap_reached`.
- Every sync JSON call goes through `apiRequest`: the batch POST `/sync` (60s timeout, module constant `SYNC_BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS`), `GET /sync/changes` (via the new `buildSyncChangesPath`), the attachment confirm PUT, and `POST /surveys/:id/submit`. A batch-level 401/403 is classified `"auth"` by `classifyRequestError` and rethrown untouched — no queue row is touched — so `withAuthRetry` can refresh the token and retry the whole batch (T-01.5-31).
- `applyRemoteChanges` reads `sync_blocked` alongside `sync_state` for every survey in the pull response: an update is skipped when the survey has any pending/failed queue row or `sync_blocked = 1`; a remote deletion is skipped unless the only queue rows present (if any) are `survey_delete`, or the survey isn't `sync_blocked` — otherwise the survey and its attachments are kept. Pulled attachments are inserted with `file_state = 'remote'`; an update never touches `local_uri`, and only resets `file_state` from `'unavailable'` back to `'remote'` (so plan 06's on-demand download gets one more try), leaving `'local'`/`'missing'` alone.
- Removed `isTerminalSurveyError`, `isTerminalAttachmentError`, and `safeJson` from `utils.ts` (unused after the rewrite — sync.ts no longer inspects error messages to decide terminality, and every response now goes through `apiRequest`'s own JSON parsing).

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Explicit failure classifiers and the apiRequest body timeout** - `0cc4406` (feat, tests included per TDD)
2. **Task 2: Classification-driven failure handling, apiRequest for every sync JSON call, pull guard** - `2998053` (feat, tests included per TDD)

_Both tasks were `tdd="true"`; test files were authored alongside the implementation in each commit._

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/storage/utils.ts` - `FailureClassification` type, `classifyRequestError`/`classifyBatchResult`/`classifyUploadFailure`, `buildSyncChangesPath` (with `buildSyncChangesUrl` now delegating to it); removed `isTerminalSurveyError`/`isTerminalAttachmentError`/`safeJson`
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts` - `resolveFailureOutcome` + rewritten failure handlers, `apiRequest` for the batch POST/changes GET/confirm PUT/submit POST, pull guard in `applyRemoteChanges`, `file_state` handling for pulled attachments
- `mobile/src/api/client.ts` - `apiRequest`'s timeout now covers the response body read via `Promise.race`
- `mobile/src/api/client.test.ts` - two new cases: a stalled body read times out, a normal response still parses and clears the timer
- `mobile/src/storage/sync-classification.test.ts` - pure unit tests for the three classifiers and `buildSyncChangesPath`
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.retry.sqlite.test.ts` - real-SQL proof per failure class (20 non-counted retryable attempts stay `failed`/`retry_count 0`; 7 counted `unknown` attempts increment, the 8th blocks; fatal blocks at once; an unparsable batch response counts once; attachment_delete rows follow the same classes; a batch 401 rejects and leaves every row untouched)
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.pull.sqlite.test.ts` - real-SQL proof that a pull never overwrites/deletes a survey with a pending queue row or `sync_blocked = 1`, that a survey already queued for its own delete still gets removed, and that pulled-attachment `file_state` follows the documented rules
- `mobile/src/storage.test.ts` - migrated the `syncPending`/`pullRemoteChanges` `describe` blocks' `global.fetch` mocks from `{ ok, json }` to the `apiRequest`-compatible `{ ok, status, text }` shape, without changing what they assert

## Decisions Made
- `resolveFailureOutcome` is shared by all three failure handlers instead of duplicating the fatal/retryable/unknown branching three times — the only per-entity differences (which table gets updated, whether `sync_blocked` applies) stay local to each handler.
- `classifyUploadFailure`'s `ApiError` branch treats any non-401/403/408/429/5xx status as fatal (a default, not an enumerated list), so the same classifier serves both the still-`fetch`-based upload helpers (owned by plan 11) and the new `apiRequest`-based confirm PUT without needing two separate code paths.
- `submitSurvey` only special-cases `ApiError` instances (expired/422/generic-failure branches read `error.status`/`error.body`); any other thrown value (network error, etc.) is rethrown unchanged, preserving the function's pre-`apiRequest` behavior for non-HTTP failures.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written. The interfaces section's line-number references had shifted slightly by the time this plan ran (as it warned they might, "after plan 03's type change"); no functional deviation resulted.

## Issues Encountered
- Needed `npm ci` at the worktree root before any test/lint/typecheck command would run (`node_modules` did not exist yet in this worktree) — this is expected per-worktree setup, not a plan issue.
- Accidentally ran `git stash push` while investigating an unrelated "Jest did not exit" warning after the full mobile suite passed — recovered immediately via `git stash apply <sha>` (not `pop`) using the SHA captured from `git stash list --format='%H %gs'`, verified `git status --short` matched the pre-stash working tree exactly, then dropped that specific stash entry by its `stash@{n}` ref. No work was lost; the underlying warning is a pre-existing, non-blocking Jest condition (exit code 0 both before and after investigation) unrelated to this plan's changes and out of this plan's scope.
- `npx prettier --write` was required on the two new test files, `sync-classification.test.ts`, `sync.ts`, and `utils.ts` after the initial TDD pass; re-ran the full lint/typecheck/test/coverage/format suite afterward to confirm no regressions.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 10 (transactions for sync.ts's writers) and plan 11 (streaming attachment upload/download integration) can build on `sync.ts`'s failure handlers already taking an explicit `classification`, and on `classifyUploadFailure` already covering both the legacy `fetch`-based upload helpers and an `apiRequest`-based confirm call.
- `sync.ts` itself still performs multi-statement reads/writes outside `runInTransaction` (out of this plan's scope, owned by plan 10, consistent with plan 05's note that only `surveys.ts` was transactionalized).
- Full mobile suite from the worktree: 54 test suites / 717 tests pass; `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` all clean (exit 0) at the repo root, run from this worktree's root as required.
