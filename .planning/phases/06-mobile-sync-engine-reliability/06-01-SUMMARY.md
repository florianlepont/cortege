  - "Dropped the { size: true } option from FileSystem.getInfoAsync: SDK 57's legacy InfoOptions type only exposes { md5? }, and FileInfo already reports size unconditionally when the file exists"
  - "Extended the expo-file-system-legacy mock's deleteAsync default to treat any trailing-slash URI as a directory delete, not only URIs previously registered via makeDirectoryAsync, so deleteAllAttachmentFiles works without the caller creating the directory first in a test"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 01: Native module foundation and photo path owner Summary

**Installed expo-crypto/expo-file-system/expo-image/expo-image-manipulator at SDK 57 via `npx expo install`, gave Jest deterministic in-memory doubles for all four, and built `attachment-files.ts` as the single tested owner of photo file paths (dir resolution, old-iOS-container rebasing, scoped delete).**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~55 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T06:37:00Z (approx, worktree setup)
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T07:32:20Z
- **Tasks:** 3 completed
- **Files modified:** 10 (4 dependency/config files, 4 new mocks, 1 new module, 1 new test file)

## Accomplishments
- The four native modules required by the rest of the phase (D-02) are now in `mobile/package.json` and `package-lock.json` exactly as `npx expo install` picked them for SDK 57, verified with `npm ls` (no missing/invalid), `expo-doctor@1.20.4` (20/20 checks, dependency-version check skipped per plan), and `expo export --platform android` (bundled cleanly, no `ios/`/`android/` dirs committed)
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` exits 0 — the 25 findings reported are all moderate-severity, in Expo tooling's own transitive dependency graph, none isolated to the four newly-added packages
- All four modules have controllable Jest doubles wired through the global `moduleNameMapper`, so every later plan (05, 06, 07, 09, 11) can import the real modules in `src/` and get deterministic behavior in tests without touching native bindings
- `attachment-files.ts` is the one place that knows where photo files live: `documentDirectory/attachments/`, re-basing stored URIs after an iOS container UUID change (D-09), and refusing to delete anything outside that directory (T-01.5-01)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Install the four SDK 57 modules with expo install and prove expo-doctor / expo export** - `c5cf7ee` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Jest doubles for the four modules and global moduleNameMapper wiring** - `4e49790` (test)
3. **Task 3: attachment-files.ts, the single owner of photo paths** - `0fc77f6` (test, RED) then `c3f0df5` (feat, GREEN)

**Plan metadata:** committed alongside this SUMMARY (see final commit)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/package.json` - added expo-crypto ~57.0.3, expo-file-system ~57.0.7, expo-image ~57.0.5, expo-image-manipulator ~57.0.20
- `package-lock.json` - lockfile entries for the four packages (npm workspaces)
- `mobile/app.json` - `expo-image` config plugin auto-registered by `expo install`; array formatting normalized with prettier
- `mobile/jest.unit.config.js` - four new `moduleNameMapper` entries (`expo-crypto`, `expo-file-system/legacy`, `expo-image-manipulator`, `expo-image`), coverage thresholds untouched
- `mobile/test/expo-crypto.mock.ts` - `randomUUID` backed by `node:crypto`
- `mobile/test/expo-file-system-legacy.mock.ts` - in-memory legacy FileSystem double with test helpers
- `mobile/test/expo-image-manipulator.mock.ts` - chainable manipulate/resize/renderAsync/saveAsync double
- `mobile/test/expo-image.mock.ts` - `Image`/`ImageBackground` render as null
- `mobile/src/storage/attachment-files.ts` - photo path/file I/O helpers over `expo-file-system/legacy`
- `mobile/src/storage/attachment-files.test.ts` - 24 unit tests covering every documented behaviour

## Decisions Made
- Kept the `expo-image` config plugin that `expo install` added automatically to `app.json` rather than reverting it — it is exactly the CNG-only native config the plan anticipated might be needed, and expo-doctor and expo export both pass with it in place.
- Ran `npx prettier --write` on the new mock files as instructed, but caught and reverted an over-application of prettier to `jest.unit.config.js` (a `.js` file outside the root `format:check` glob and outside the plan's "new files" instruction), restoring its pre-existing single-quote style so the diff is minimal and the plan's grep-based verification (`'^expo-image$'` with single quotes) passes.
- Dropped `{ size: true }` from the `getInfoAsync` call in `attachment-files.ts`: the actual SDK 57 `InfoOptions` type only declares `{ md5? }`, and `FileInfo` already includes `size` unconditionally when the file exists, so the option was a type error with no runtime effect.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Removed non-existent `{ size: true }` getInfoAsync option**
- **Found during:** Task 3 (attachment-files.ts implementation, GREEN phase)
- **Issue:** The plan text says `getLocalFileSize uses getInfoAsync(uri, { size: true })`, but the verified SDK 57 `expo-file-system/legacy` `InfoOptions` type (`node_modules/expo-file-system/build/legacy/FileSystem.types.d.ts`) only has `{ md5?: boolean }`. Passing `{ size: true }` failed `tsc`.
- **Fix:** Called `getInfoAsync(resolveAttachmentUri(uri))` with no options; `FileInfo` already reports `size` whenever `exists: true`.
- **Files modified:** mobile/src/storage/attachment-files.ts
- **Verification:** `npm run typecheck` and the full attachment-files test suite pass
- **Committed in:** c3f0df5 (Task 3 GREEN commit)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Extended the file-system mock's deleteAsync to recognize any trailing-slash URI as a directory**
- **Found during:** Task 3 (deleteAllAttachmentFiles test)
- **Issue:** The mock's default `deleteAsync` only treated a URI as a directory delete if it had been explicitly registered via `makeDirectoryAsync`. `deleteAllAttachmentFiles()` calls `deleteAsync(getAttachmentsDirUri(), { idempotent: true })` directly without ever calling `ensureAttachmentsDir()` first (matching the plan's spec, which lists them as separate, independent functions), so the directory-prefix delete silently did nothing in the test.
- **Fix:** `defaultDeleteAsync` now also treats any URI ending in `/` as a directory-prefix delete.
- **Files modified:** mobile/test/expo-file-system-legacy.mock.ts
- **Verification:** `deleteAllAttachmentFiles` test passes (removes attachments-dir files, leaves cache files); full mobile suite (524 tests) still green
- **Committed in:** c3f0df5 (Task 3 GREEN commit)

**3. [Rule 1 - Bug] Reverted prettier's reformatting of jest.unit.config.js from single to double quotes**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (after running `npx prettier --write` on the mock files and, by mistake, also on jest.unit.config.js)
- **Issue:** `jest.unit.config.js` is a `.js` file, excluded from the root `format:check` glob (`**/*.{ts,tsx,json}`) and from the plan's "run prettier on the new files" instruction. Reformatting it to double quotes changed 27 unrelated lines and broke the plan's single-quote-anchored grep verification (`'^expo-image$'`), which would have reported only 3 matches instead of the required 4.
- **Fix:** Rewrote the file preserving its original single-quote style, keeping only the four new `moduleNameMapper` lines as an actual diff.
- **Files modified:** mobile/jest.unit.config.js
- **Verification:** `grep -c "expo-file-system/legacy\|expo-image-manipulator\|expo-crypto\|'\^expo-image\$'" mobile/jest.unit.config.js` returns 4; full mobile test suite and format:check pass
- **Committed in:** 4e49790 (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 3 auto-fixed (1 blocking type error, 2 bugs — one in a new test double, one in my own formatting step)
**Impact on plan:** All three were necessary corrections with no scope creep; none changed the module's public API or behavior described in `must_haves`.

## Issues Encountered
None beyond the deviations above.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plans 05, 06, 07, 09 and 11 can now `import` `expo-crypto`, `expo-file-system/legacy`, `expo-image` and `expo-image-manipulator` in `src/` and get working, controllable Jest doubles.
- `mobile/src/storage/attachment-files.ts` is ready to be the shared photo-path module for capture (plan 07), upload (plan 09/06), download/cache (plan 11) and purge (plan 05/07) work.
- No architectural blockers identified. This plan intentionally did not touch `sync.ts`, `db.ts` or any hook — those are owned by later, sequenced plans per the wave ordering in CONTEXT.md.
