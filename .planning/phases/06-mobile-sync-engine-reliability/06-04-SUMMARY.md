    provides: useAuth0Session restore flow, clearSession, classifyCredentialsError
provides:
  - "sub-keyed local_meta profile cache (mobile/src/storage/profile-cache.ts)"
  - "offline cold start: cached /me profile opens signed-in screens when the API is unreachable (D-13)"
  - "background profile refresh (network-online listener + 60s poll) that self-stops once /me succeeds"
  - "autosave reschedule: an edit that arrives while a save is in flight is no longer dropped"

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "best-effort key/value cache in local_meta, mirroring local-owner.ts's upsert shape"
    - "runAutosaveRef pattern: a ref-held async function reassigned every render so a setTimeout callback always closes over the latest props without re-triggering the debounce effect"

  modified:
    - mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts
    - mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.test.ts
    - mobile/src/hooks/useEditingDraft.ts

key-decisions:
  - "Cache is looked up with the local `sessionOwner` variable computed during restore, not the React state, to avoid a stale-closure read"
  - "profileFromCache flips back to false as soon as any successful /me call happens (restore, login, register, forgot-password, handleLoadMyProfile), which lets the refresh effect's own dependency array tear down the listener/interval without an extra flag"
  - "autosave follow-up requests are represented by data (surveyId, input, visibility, signature) captured at schedule time, not by re-reading outer hook state after an await, eliminating the stale-closure risk"

patterns-established:
  - "PROFILE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS module constant + a single in-flight ref guard for any future background poll added to a hook"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 04: Offline cold start via cached profile + autosave reschedule Summary

**Sub-keyed `local_meta` profile cache backs an offline cold start (D-13), and useEditingDraft now reschedules an in-flight autosave instead of dropping the latest edit.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~45 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T07:10:00Z (approx, worktree setup)
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T07:36:06Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6 (3 created, 3 modified)

## Accomplishments
- A signed-in user with valid stored Auth0 credentials but no network now lands on the signed-in screens with their last known `/me` profile, instead of the login overlay
- The cached profile is strictly scoped to the Auth0 `sub` it was captured for; a stale cache from a different account, or a corrupted cache value, is never surfaced
- While showing a cached profile, the app retries `/me` on the next network-online event and every 60 s while online (single in-flight guard), replacing the cached profile once `/me` succeeds, then stops
- `clearSession` (logout, session-ended classification, `AUTH_REQUIRED`) clears the cached profile; `AUTH_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE` paths are untouched, matching the phase 01.2 rule
- Autosave no longer drops a draft edit that arrives while the previous save is still writing: the latest request is stored and runs immediately after the in-flight save finishes

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: profile-cache storage module (sub-keyed, best-effort)** - `326764b` (feat)
2. **Task 2: useAuth0Session uses the cached profile offline and refreshes it when the API is reachable** - `84dbc8e` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Autosave reschedules instead of skipping while a save is in flight** - `4615167` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** commit pending (this SUMMARY + final metadata commit)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/storage/profile-cache.ts` - `CACHED_PROFILE_KEY`, `saveCachedProfile`/`loadCachedProfile`/`clearCachedProfile` on `local_meta`, best-effort (every function catches its own errors)
- `mobile/src/storage/profile-cache.sqlite.test.ts` - real-SQL tests: round-trip, wrong-sub isolation, single-slot replace, clear, corrupted JSON, corrupted shape, table-missing before `initLocalDb()`
- `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.ts` - restore effect falls back to `loadCachedProfile(sessionOwner.sub)` when `/me` fails; every successful `/me` call (restore, login, register, forgot-password, `handleLoadMyProfile`) writes the cache; `profileFromCache` state drives a network-listener + 60 s-interval refresh effect; `clearSession` clears the cache
- `mobile/src/hooks/useAuth0Session.test.ts` - 9 new tests under "D-13 offline cold start: cached profile" covering all 8 behaviours from the plan plus the network-listener-removed assertion; all 18 pre-existing tests still pass
- `mobile/src/hooks/useEditingDraft.ts` - `pendingAutosaveRef` + `runAutosaveRef` (reassigned every render) replace the bare `return` on in-flight, so a request made mid-save is queued and re-run once the in-flight save finishes; `editingSurveyIdRef` guards against running a follow-up for a survey no longer being edited; pending requests are cleared wherever the timer used to be cleared (stop editing, explicit create/save)
- `mobile/src/hooks/useEditingDraft.autosave.test.ts` - 5 renderHook + fake-timer tests: reschedule-not-drop, three-quick-changes-one-follow-up, identical-signature-no-save, editing-stopped-no-follow-up, rejection-reports-then-later-change-saves

## Decisions Made
- Reused the `local-owner.ts` upsert SQL shape and `local_meta` table for the cache (RESEARCH V8 trust tier), rather than a new table
- `handleForgotPassword`'s successful-login branch also writes the cache, for consistency with the other three `/me` success call sites, even though it wasn't explicitly listed as a required behaviour (kept the four call sites uniform)
- Kept `useEditingDraft.test.ts` (React-spy style) untouched and added the reschedule proof in a separate `renderHook`-style file, per PATTERNS.md guidance not to mix the two styles in one file

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. `handleForgotPassword`'s cache write is a direct extension of the same "every successful `getMyProfile` call site" instruction in the plan's `<action>`, not a scope addition.

## Issues Encountered
- An early draft of the "retried every 60s, stops after success" test queued two `mockRejectedValueOnce` calls but only consumed one during restore; the second stale rejection was then dequeued ahead of the later `mockResolvedValue`, making the retry appear to fail. Fixed by queuing exactly one rejection (consumed during restore) before switching the mock to `mockResolvedValue` for the retry.
- `npx prettier --write` was needed once on `useAuth0Session.ts` and once on `useEditingDraft.autosave.test.ts` after hand-editing; both re-verified with the full test/lint/typecheck/format suite afterward.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- `profile-cache.ts` is available for any other plan in this phase that needs to read/write the cached profile
- `useAuth0Session.ts` and `useEditingDraft.ts` were touched only by this plan in wave 1; other wave plans touching `sync.ts`/`db.ts`/`useSurveySync*.ts` are unaffected
- No blockers for later plans in phase 01.5
