# Phase 01.5 Plan 12: Phase gate Summary

**The integrated phase passed the local gate and a green CI run on PR #150. The owner merged it and checked the result on an iPhone. Existing data survived the upgrade; photos were captured offline, resized and synced; the missing-file state was shown; server photos came back after a reinstall. The offline cold-start device check is carried over.**

## Accomplishments

- **Local gate:**
  - lint, typecheck, format;
  - unit tests with coverage: API 162, mobile 757;
  - E2E 83/83, run twice;
  - expo-doctor 20/20, `expo export`, `npm audit`;
  - coverage ratchet `ratchet ok` for both configs.
- **PR CI:** PR https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/pull/150, run https://github.com/florianlepont/cortege/actions/runs/36115841093. All jobs passed.
- **Main build:** run 36120385979 passed. After deploy, the new `download-url` route answers 401 without a token.
- **Owner device check** (iPhone, dev build): existing surveys intact, offline photos, size under 2 MB, missing-file message, sync with no error, server photos after reinstall. All passed.

## Deviations from Plan

1. **Device check method changed.** The plan's steps assumed airplane mode on a dev build, which cannot reload JS offline. The check was redone on a dev build with airplane mode switched on after the app loaded.
2. **Offline cold start (criterion 7) not checked on a device.** It needs a Release build, and the Release build shows a separate navigation problem: JS tab bar, "Mes relevés" not working. This phase did not touch navigation (package versions are identical, and the navigator-selection code is unchanged). The owner deferred the investigation. Criterion 7 remains covered by the plan 04 unit and renderHook tests.
3. The owner merged PR #150 before step 1 ("create a survey with the old app") could be done offline. Existing-data survival was checked with the surveys already on the phone.

## Issues Encountered

- Release-build navigation problem and a missing liquid-glass tab bar in the dev build. Both are tracked as a pending todo in STATE.md.
