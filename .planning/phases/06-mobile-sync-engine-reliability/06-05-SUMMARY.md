    - "Fault injection with a scoped SQLite BEFORE trigger (RAISE(ABORT, 'injected') on a specific row/table) proves each writer's rollback, following the same recipe as phase 01.4's event-insert trigger and this phase's plan 03 pattern"

# Phase 01.5 Plan 05: Transactional surveys.ts writers, UUID ids, op_type, photo cleanup Summary

**Every multi-statement writer in mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts now runs inside plan 03's `runInTransaction`, new ids come from `expo-crypto randomUUID()` instead of `Date.now()`, every `sync_queue` insert carries its `op_type`, and photo files are deleted only after their row's delete commits.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~35 min
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 3 (1 created, 2 modified)

## Accomplishments
- `createLocalDraft`, `queueLocalAttachment`, `queueDeleteAttachment`, `queueDeleteSurvey`, `updateLocalDraft`, `clearLocalIbpData`, `retrySurveyNow` and `discardSurveyLocalChanges` each wrap their full read-check-write body in a single `runInTransaction(async (tx) => ...)` call, so an injected failure on any later statement leaves the database exactly as it was before the call — proven with 8 trigger-based fault-injection tests (one per writer).
- New survey ids and new local attachment ids are v4 UUIDs from `expo-crypto`'s `randomUUID()`; a survey seeded with a legacy `survey-<timestamp>` id can still be updated and deleted through the same code paths.
- All 5 `INSERT INTO sync_queue` statements in `surveys.ts` now write an explicit `op_type` column (`survey_upsert`, `survey_delete`, `attachment_upload`, `attachment_delete`) at insert time, instead of leaving it to be backfilled or derived later.
- Deleting an attachment (`queueDeleteAttachment`), deleting a survey (`queueDeleteSurvey`), discarding local changes (`discardSurveyLocalChanges`) and the explicit local data purge (`clearLocalIbpData`) all select the `local_uri` values of the rows about to be removed *inside* the transaction, then call `deleteAttachmentFile`/`deleteAllAttachmentFiles` (best-effort, errors swallowed) only after the transaction has committed — a rejected transaction never deletes a file, proven by a rejected `queueDeleteAttachment` test asserting the file is still present.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fault-injection tests for every multi-statement writer, UUIDs and op_type** - `94d4cf0` (test, RED)
2. **Task 2: Wrap surveys.ts writers in runInTransaction, UUID ids, op_type, post-commit file cleanup** - `6412a10` (feat, GREEN)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile/src/storage/surveys.transactions.sqlite.test.ts` - 19 tests: 8 trigger-based rollback proofs (one per writer), 2 UUID-format checks, 5 op_type checks, 1 legacy-id compatibility check, 1 sequential-reentrancy check, 2 post-commit file-cleanup checks
- `mobile/src/storage/surveys.ts` - every writer wrapped in `runInTransaction`; `randomUUID()` replaces `Date.now()`-based ids; `op_type` added to every `sync_queue` insert; post-commit `deleteAttachmentFile`/`deleteAllAttachmentFiles` calls added
- `mobile/src/storage.test.ts` - updated the two id-format assertions (`createLocalDraft`, `queueLocalAttachment`) from the old `survey-`/`attachment-` prefix regexes to the UUID v4 regex

## Decisions Made
- Followed the plan's locked interface: writers accept a `DbExecutor`/`TxHandle` via `runInTransaction`, and `deleteQueuedSurveyUpserts(tx, id)` is passed the live handle rather than `db`, joining the same transaction instead of nesting one.
- Ordered `sync_queue` INSERT columns as `(survey_id, op_type, payload, ...)` specifically so the plan's grep-based acceptance check (`INSERT INTO sync_queue (survey_id, op_type`) passes literally, rather than appending `op_type` at the end of the column list.
- In the fault-injection test file, used `jest.fn().mockImplementationOnce()` on the (already-mocked) `expo-crypto` `randomUUID` to pin a predictable id for each trigger's `WHEN` clause, resetting to the real `node:crypto`-backed default in `beforeEach` so no override leaks across tests — this mirrors the mock's own reset convention from plan 01.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed as written. One clarification worth noting: the plan's task 1 `<action>` describes triggers generically ("a test-local `CREATE TRIGGER ...`"); the implementation inlines the `RAISE(ABORT, 'injected')` body at each of the 8 call sites (rather than hiding it in one shared helper) specifically so the file satisfies the plan's own acceptance criterion of `grep -c "RAISE(ABORT" >= 5` while keeping the fault visible at the point of use — not a deviation from behavior, just a implementation-detail choice serving the plan's stated verification method.

## Issues Encountered
- Initially ran `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit` from the main repo checkout instead of this worktree, which silently skipped the new test file (it doesn't exist outside the worktree) and under-reported the suite count. Re-ran every verification command from the worktree root; the full 47-suite / 591-test run, coverage, lint, typecheck and format:check all confirmed green from the correct working directory.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plans 06, 07, 08, 10 and 11 can rely on `surveys.ts`'s writers being transactional, on new ids being UUIDs, and on every `sync_queue` row already carrying its `op_type` at creation time.
- `mobile/src/storage/sync.ts` still performs multi-statement reads/writes outside `runInTransaction` (noted as out of scope by plan 03's summary and unchanged here, since this plan's `files_modified` scope was limited to `surveys.ts` and its tests) — the plans that own `sync.ts` (06/07/08) still need to route its writers through `runInTransaction`.
- Full mobile suite from the worktree: 47 test suites / 591 tests pass; `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format:check` and `npm --workspace mobile run test:unit:coverage` all clean at the repo root.
