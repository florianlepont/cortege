# Phase 01.5 Plan 02: Attachment download endpoint Summary

**Added `GET /v1/surveys/:id/attachments/:attachmentId/download-url` (presigned GET in MinIO/S3 mode, authenticated content route in local mode) and its local-mode `StreamableFile` backing route, proven end to end on PostgreSQL.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 33 min
- **Started:** 2026-09-25T07:00:00Z (approx)
- **Completed:** 2026-09-25T07:33:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5 (2 created, 3 modified)

## Accomplishments

- `SurveysAttachmentsService.getAttachmentDownload` returns `{ url, expires_at, requires_auth }` with the same shape in both storage modes, per D-01/D-18.
- `SurveysAttachmentsService.getAttachmentContent` streams local-mode bytes through a new `GET .../content` route using the `StreamableFile` pattern already used by `users.controller.ts`.
- Path-traversal containment (`resolve(root, storage_key)` must stay under `root`) proven with a unit test using a `../../etc/passwd` storage key.
- Ownership, upload-state and deletion rules proven end to end on PostgreSQL: owner success (both storage-mode branches), another user's 404, not-yet-uploaded 409, deleted-attachment 404, missing-token 401, unknown-id 404.
- `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md` documents both routes right after `GET /surveys/{id}/attachments`.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically (TDD: RED then GREEN for Task 1):

1. **Task 1 (RED): failing unit spec for both storage modes** - `df7507e` (test)
2. **Task 1 (GREEN): service methods and routes** - `3f3ef05` (feat)
3. **Task 2: E2E proof and API contract docs** - `c879cd6` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/src/surveys/surveys-attachments.service.ts` - Added `getAttachmentDownload`, `getAttachmentContent`, private `getUploadedAttachmentOrThrow` and `buildDownloadUrl` helpers, `GetObjectCommand`/`ConflictException` imports, `DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS` constant
- `api/src/surveys/surveys.controller.ts` - Added `GET :id/attachments/:attachmentId/download-url` and `GET :id/attachments/:attachmentId/content` routes under the existing class-level `AuthGuard`
- `api/test/surveys-attachments-download.spec.ts` - 9 unit cases covering both storage modes, ownership, upload state, missing file and path traversal, with `fs/promises`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` and `@aws-sdk/client-s3` mocked
- `api/test/attachments-download.e2e-spec.ts` - 6 E2E cases against PostgreSQL/local storage mode
- `docs/technical/api-contract-v1.md` - New sections for the two routes with request/response examples and error rules

## Decisions Made

- Kept the download endpoint strictly additive and read-only (no `db.transaction`, no new event row), matching the plan's scope boundary that this is the only `api/` change of the phase.
- `getAttachmentContent` checks `objectStorageMode !== "local"` after the ownership check but before the uploaded-attachment lookup, so a minio-mode request never queries the attachments table for the content route (cheap 404 for a route that structurally cannot serve those files).
- E2E environment provided by the orchestrator runs `OBJECT_STORAGE_MODE=local`, so the owner-success test exercises the local `requires_auth: true` branch on PostgreSQL; the minio `requires_auth: false` presigned-GET branch is proven in the unit spec with a mocked S3 client, per the plan's read_first/interfaces guidance (no local MinIO instance is part of this phase's environment).

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. `npm ci` was run at the worktree root because `node_modules` was absent, per the parallel-execution instructions (not a plan deviation).

## Issues Encountered

- Initial unit spec attempt for the minio branch made a real network call to `127.0.0.1:9000` inside `ensureS3Bucket()`'s `HeadBucketCommand` fallback; fixed by mocking `@aws-sdk/client-s3`'s `S3Client` constructor to return a stub `send` while keeping the real command classes (needed for `getSignedUrl` call-argument assertions).
- First `npm run test:e2e` invocation on the full suite failed with 403s because the environment variables exported in a prior Bash call were not present in the new shell; re-exported them in the same invocation as the test command and the full 13-suite/83-test run passed.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 06 (mobile server-photo display) can call `GET /v1/surveys/:id/attachments/:attachmentId/download-url` and, when `requires_auth` is true, `GET /v1/surveys/:id/attachments/:attachmentId/content` with the bearer token, exactly as documented in `api-contract-v1.md`.
- No blockers. This was the only `api/` change of the phase (D-01); storage unification remains deferred to phase 01.6.
