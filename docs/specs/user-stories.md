# Product Specifications - IBP Mobile

## 1) Vision
Enable users to complete IBP surveys quickly, reliably, and in a standardized way, even in low-connectivity environments, on iOS and Android.
Build a participatory experience where contributors can follow IBP activity across French forests and stay engaged through gamification.
The app is a public-interest project led by the association Etats-Sauvages and its members.

## 2) Goals
- Make IBP assessments easier to perform for non-expert contributors, despite methodological complexity.
- Reduce the average time needed to complete a full survey.
- Decrease data entry errors and missing fields.
- Ensure traceability (who, when, where, what).
- Synchronize surveys to a shared community database.
- Enable nationwide visibility of completed IBP surveys (France).
- Increase long-term contributor engagement through points and progression.
- Increase visibility and awareness for the association Etats-Sauvages.
- Drive users toward donation flows that support the association mission.

## 3) Personas
- Contributor: voluntarily submits IBP surveys and follows personal/community impact.
- Community Moderator (Etats-Sauvages member): reviews reported issues, manages basic moderation, and updates app content/rules.

## 4) Scope (V1)
- User authentication.
- Basic user profile management (first name, last name, display name, profile picture).
- List of personal surveys (draft, submitted, synced).
- Survey-to-parcel linkage using French cadastral parcel identifiers.
- Longitudinal parcel tracking (multi-year history and comparison of IBP total + factor scores).
- Survey versioning per parcel context (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...).
- Guided IBP survey entry (required/optional fields).
- On-demand pedagogical help during survey entry for complex IBP fields.
- Photo attachments and geolocation.
- Offline mode + synchronization.
- Survey statuses (draft, expired, submitted, synced, error).
- Personal point counter based on completed IBP surveys.
- Explore map focused on parcel analysis in France (parcel status, latest IBP score, and access to parcel history). The map loads the public surveys of the visible area once the user stops moving it, and groups nearby surveys into clusters; tapping a cluster zooms in, or lists its surveys when zooming cannot separate them (surveys of the same parcels share one point).
- User-controlled survey visibility: private (default) or public (shared with community).
- Post-publication survey management (delete survey, switch private/public).
- Association visibility surfaces in-app (mission, impact, actions).
- Donation call-to-action in key user journey moments.

## 8) Backlog (Out of MVP Scope)

Corrected 2026-09-27 (`.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`): the community/moderation workflow and team
challenges are the next milestone after this one (Epic E and Epic F are both labelled **V1** in
their own epic documents), not V2 — they were previously filed under "V2 Backlog" here by mistake.

### Deferred to the next milestone (V1)
- Community moderation workflow with approval/rejection for flagged surveys.
- Team challenges (city/association/organization competitions).

### V2 Backlog
- Push notifications (new badges, ranking updates, moderation feedback).
- Excel export (the PDF export is built on the phone: Phase 19, rebuilt to the CNPF sheet content in Phase 25.1).
- KPI dashboards (average time, error rate, sync success rate).
- Forest analytics and insights in Explore (regional score summaries, trends, factor distributions).
- Multi-language support.
- In-app documentation section (learning hub) to explore IBP methodology outside survey flow.
- Advanced donation features (recurring donation, campaign-specific donation, donation impact dashboard).
- Seasonal events and limited-time missions.
- Social sharing of milestones (optional).

## 5) Cross-Epic Business Rules
- A survey is linked to a single site (or checkpoint).
- A survey must be linked to one cadastral parcel (`parcel_id`) before submission.
- GPS/manual address remains required for positioning, but is not the primary business identifier of a survey.
- Some fields are mandatory depending on survey type.
- A photo may be required to validate certain anomalies.
- A survey can only be submitted when all required fields are completed.
- A survey can only be submitted when cadastral linkage is valid (`parcel_id` resolved and confirmed).
- Surveys on the same parcel are tracked longitudinally by observation year and version number.
- Historical comparison must be available at parcel level (IBP total trend + factor-by-factor trend).
- Explore is a parcel intelligence surface (parcel status + parcel scores), not a generic point-only map.
- Each submitted survey has a visibility setting: `private` or `public`.
- Only `public` surveys are eligible for community surfaces (public map, community feeds, public stats).
- Changing a survey from `public` to `private` must remove it from community surfaces.
- Deleting a survey must remove it from community surfaces.
- Pedagogical content must be accessible on demand during survey entry without interrupting form completion.
- ~~A draft survey expires 7 days after creation; after that, it becomes expired ("caduc") and cannot be submitted.~~ Removed (OA-41 2026-10-06): there is no submission deadline.
- Public map data is anonymized (no personal data exposed). Viewport loading and clustering do not change this. A survey is placed at the exact centre of its parcels (public cadastre information, owner decision 2026-10-08, no longer rounded to about 1 km) and no survey id is shown.
- At high zoom level, map surfaces (create/update/detail/explore) must display cadastral parcels and their study status (`studied` vs `not_studied`).
- Points are awarded only for valid submitted surveys (not drafts).
- Anti-cheat rules are needed (duplicate locations, spam submissions, fake entries).
- Donation prompts must stay transparent and non-blocking for core app usage.

## 9) Non-Functional Requirements
- Platforms:

  - Android minimum supported version: Android 12 (API 31).
  - App Store / Play publishing targets must follow current store requirements (latest supported SDK/target API).
- Performance: app launch time < 3 seconds on target devices.
- Offline reliability: no draft data loss in case of forced app closure.
- Security: encrypted local storage for sensitive data, API communication over TLS.
- GDPR: data minimization and a defined data retention policy.
- Privacy by design: public map and leaderboard data must be anonymized/pseudonymized.

## 10) Open Questions
- What exact fields make up an IBP survey (detailed data model)?
- Which business validations are blocking vs non-blocking?
- What are the exact roles and associated permissions (contributor, moderator)?
- What is the conflict resolution policy during synchronization?
- Are GPS and photos mandatory for all survey types?
- Which cadastral source should be authoritative in production (Cadastre API, vector tiles mirror, or hybrid)?
- What is the exact rule for multiple submissions on the same parcel and year (single submitted version vs multiple versions)?
- What precision/tiling strategy should be used for parcel rendering in offline mode?
- What exact scoring model should be used (base points, bonus, penalties)?
- Which statistical rules should be applied for regional analytics (minimum sample size, outlier handling, confidence display)?
- Is ranking individual-only, or also by teams/organizations?
- What level of geographic precision is acceptable for public map display?
- What moderation policy should Etats-Sauvages apply for disputed surveys?
